I was skeptical of these since they are not a Gore Tex product however they are very water proof even when running through streams. The problem is that of all my water proof shoes these are the least breathable and my feet sweat nearly immediately after putting them on. To be fair my Asics Gore Tex are even worse but other brands like Asolo, Arcteryx and Patagonia are far superior in breathability. So bottomline is these are great for bad weather but are terrible as a daily wear pair of sneaks. Although your feet will stay dry from outside elements, you will have very sweaty wet feet on the inside."

I received the 2nd pair size 9/ 4E very fast shipping. The fit was perfect. The shoe looks great and very lightweight. The insole is very very thin.

Super lightweight and comfortable.  Only had them a short while so can't comment on durability.  The only issue I had was that I had to exchange sizes initially. I usually wear a 10.5 in New Balance and it seemed most people felt like these ran the same as New Balance so I got the 10.5. I ended up exchanging them for a 10 which fit perfectly.

After wearing them awhile however, they seemed to have conformed to my feet and the support has firmed up. All in all, definately like them, and will be buying them again.

I have been a New Balance 990 guy for the last twenty or so years. I was ready to push the button here on v5 when a little more hipper spirit nudged me over to the Brooks' side of Zappos. 

While in Brooksville, I travelled to where the Adrenalines hang out.  They looked cool, light, comfy, and came in widths. I chose the stealth black 13 4E. 

I speed walk with my Labrador Retriever 6 miles a day and I'm happy to say I may be faster, certainly more comfortable, and obviously overjoyed in my selection. And yes, I'm coming back for more Adrenaline (Black / Lime and Black / Ketchup) ; one pair for my birthday, and one pair for Christmas.

I've been shopping at Zappos for about 10 years and, ladies and gentlemen, you have not let me down once. I actually look forward to returning shoes (wrong sizes) so I can hang with the customer service folks.

Thanks much for making this guy's shoe buying journey more enjoyable."

Read numerous reviews, got impressed. The Ace do look really nice. Running them is too comfortable and soft. They definitely give you special feeling and they really start to show themselves after the third mile. But my knees started to cry out loud after the second week of running 20 miles a week in Aces. Probably ""cloud"" softness is not for me. Zappos gives you 60 days trial for Brooks, no such offer for Onclouds so I have to keep them for gym visits and come back to Brooks or try Onclouds with neutral support."

Until now. 

With this pair, the padded material at the top of the right shoe's Heel Counter caused a blister to form the first day I wore them. I figured it was break-in related and continued wearing them with adhesive blister protectors over my Achilles tendon for another week. It's been almost two months now and I still have to wear a blister protector at the top of my right heel when wearing these shoes.

I'm used to feeling support, all over, and I never really feel it with these shoes. They took about a week to break in (not too difficult, mind you), and you'll need to re-set the laces to fit you more comfortably. I would not buy these again, though I'm not looking to return them either - because I'm going to use them as casual wear, and not as running shoes.

I have been a New Balance 990 guy for the last twenty or so years. I was ready to push the button here on v5 when a little more hipper spirit nudged me over to the Brooks' side of Zappos. 

While in Brooksville, I travelled to where the Adrenalines hang out.  They looked cool, light, comfy, and came in widths. I chose the stealth black 13 4E. 

I speed walk with my Labrador Retriever 6 miles a day and I'm happy to say I may be faster, certainly more comfortable, and obviously overjoyed in my selection. And yes, I'm coming back for more Adrenaline (Black / Lime and Black / Ketchup) ; one pair for my birthday, and one pair for Christmas.

I've been shopping at Zappos for about 10 years and, ladies and gentlemen, you have not let me down once. I actually look forward to returning shoes (wrong sizes) so I can hang with the customer service folks.

Thanks much for making this guy's shoe buying journey more enjoyable."

Cloud X is probably one of the lightest shoes I’ve ever worn (~8oz or so) - this comes with with trade offs:
Pro: light, does not get in the way of running and with other activities; cushion has the same cloud tech that makes it great for running with heel support
Cons: not the best for a heavy rainy day; not the best in an area with a lot uneven surfaces (ie trail running); general protection from injury is weak due to the lightness of the shoe

2. Other details
-only comes with regular shoelaces (no spandex laces like some of the other ON models)
-the back of the shoe is extremely thin, but comfortable
-would not recommend for exercises like weightlifting where you might need more ankle support for heavier lifts
-recommend for runs, sprints(HIIT), and rowing (turns out the limited support on the back of the shoe also does not tug at skin as hard as a well supported back)

Hope this is helpful!"

Overall, the shoe looks and feels similar to the 35. However, one subtle change that significantly affected fit was the rubber overlay around the top edge of the toe box. It is between 1/2 and 3/4 of an inch and goes from one side of the ball of your foot over the top of the ends of your toes and back down the other side to the ball of your foot. In speaking with Nike they said it was to provide some additional support. What I found it prevented my toes from expanding and made the toe box feel tighter. I liked previous versions because I have 10 4E feet so the shoes always fit and allowed my toes to expand. Unfortunately because of this small change I had to return the shoes and will be looking for a new everyday running shoe."

For years now, I have only been able to wear the Hoka One One brand. I also wear the Clifton 5/6 for work wear and walking. I use the Hoka recovery slide at home instead of going bare foot. These new Cavu 3 shoes are a little less bouncy in the soles, and have a slightly less rocker bottom feel to them. I purchased size 10 and 11 at another retailer (Sorry Zappos! You didn't have this color at the time). The arch placement on the size 11 was better for me, but the 11 is too wide for me. So I chose the 10. The heel cup is not as deep feeling as with the Clifton or the recovery slide, and so my foot does not rest on the arch cushion at the same place-my foot is a little too forward for the shoe. And the sole seemed too stiff at first. But I have noticed a little ""softening/flexibility"" happening with the sole, so that might make things better. I am older, so I do find this style a little hard to put on , due to arthritis. But I'm really happy with the shoe so far. I have been wanting a Hoka style that looks a little more like a fashion shoe than an athletic shoe. And one that doesn't look so HUGE on my size 10 feet."

That might be from the webbed design that this new model has over the older Clifton models. The toe box was also not right for me (too constricting) as well as strangely shaped inwards but for some reason, the length was ok. Odd. Zappos did not have a 12 1/2 so I bought that somewhere else. After three days of those Hoka Clifton 6's, I had to return them also since they literally destroyed my feet. My Plantar Fasciitis which I have not felt in 10 years of wearing Asics came back with a vengeance, as well as the slight Metatarsalgia that I have also forgotten about. This is due to the fore foot not having enough room to splay your toes correctly and not having any support for the Metatarsal region. I suppose the rocker mid sole that these shoe are known for are doing this. Bad design for me. I learned my lesson. I could only imagine if I put up with the discomfort any longer in order to ""break these in"". 

Also, these sneakers are advertised as ""neutral"" which is why I bought them in the first place but I found that the inner soles were slightly high as opposed to the outer parts of the soles that I was standing slightly uncomfortably bowed. I would NOT recommend these for anyone that has arch problems, Metatarsalgia, arthritis or Morton's Neuroma problems of any sort because these sneakers will only make those conditions much worse. They have absolutely no extra room to put your own orthotics in and only make the overall constricting feeling worse on your toes and arches.

I fell for the advertising. This new model is supposed to be the roomiest most comfortable of the whole Hoka One One line and I've seen some Foot Doctors actually recommending these because of the cushioning. The overall cushioning IS good I do admit, if that is what you are looking for, but Hoka is off my list for good."

Last year I changed to ghost 11 womens 10.5 which was super comfortable but mid year the fit was changed to more narrow. This seems to be the trend with Brooks. The wide sizes, which are limited, are just too big in the heel and instep. I don’t understand who the running  shoe companies are targeting with all the narrow shoes on the market.

It's tighter in the heel - which I like, but also very tight in the mid section. I had to go a half size up to tolerate wearing them for more than a few hours.

Cloud X is probably one of the lightest shoes I’ve ever worn (~8oz or so) - this comes with with trade offs:
Pro: light, does not get in the way of running and with other activities; cushion has the same cloud tech that makes it great for running with heel support
Cons: not the best for a heavy rainy day; not the best in an area with a lot uneven surfaces (ie trail running); general protection from injury is weak due to the lightness of the shoe

2. Other details
-only comes with regular shoelaces (no spandex laces like some of the other ON models)
-the back of the shoe is extremely thin, but comfortable
-would not recommend for exercises like weightlifting where you might need more ankle support for heavier lifts
-recommend for runs, sprints(HIIT), and rowing (turns out the limited support on the back of the shoe also does not tug at skin as hard as a well supported back)

Hope this is helpful!"

I wear a Men's 9.5 in casual shoes and 10 in running shoes. These seemed a bit long for 10, but I fear a 9.5 may be too short. The Bondi 6 in 9.5 was too short, but the 10 was perfect. I would say the Rincons run 1/4 a size bigger than the Bondi 6."

The tongue is too short like everyone else says. The heels are a little weak so I might not be able to slip these one sometime like other quality sturdy shoes. There is a little extra room around the toes. I don't this this will bother me, the room is there if you need it. 

So the heal area is cheapened and weakened a little with the mesh outer.   Some bean counter probley Oked to small tongue too.  Then they plaster Made in the USA all over these. Give me a break! You keep cheaping these shoes that you want a FORTUNE FOR.  They is no noticeable technology about this shoe. The footbed has good support and is wide but there is nothing spectacular about the insole softness.   You could get away with some $60 Sketchers.   I also buy very expensive Clarks and other high quality shoes. 

I am keeping them because of other statements about foot support but that is the only reason. I dont mind paying for a quality shoe but these dont impress me."

Cushioning was great, sung running shoe fit and a thin tongue which helps as not to bruise the top of your foot.

They felt great the second I put them on, and now that I have broken them in some, they feel even better.

I love how these shoes fit my feet like a glove. I normally wear a 9.5, that's the size I ordered, and that's the size I would stick with.

I chose the primer/ebony/black color combo and love how they look in person. I also love the woven material used in the shoe -- really cool texture and very breathable.

I used to wear Nike shoes almost exclusively (they do make great shoes), but I am now very much a Brooks fan. I highly recommend the Revel 3 (even if you're a walker and not a runner)."

I spent a week walking around and running in these shoes. My feet were hurting as it felt like pressure was being put on the ball of the foot or base of the toes due to that feeling of minimal support in the mid-foot. I liked the look but returned the shoes and went with Brooks Adrenaline which has cushy support for the entire foot.

They have ripped at the forefoot as others have mentioned, as well as had splits along then cuff (?) of the shoe.  Additionally at this point the support has gone and I can no longer run in them.  Thanks to Zappos wonderful support I returned my first pair due to this, and the now the second has had the same issue 3 months in.

I have problem with the joint of the big toes.  It is very hard to find shoes that have sufficient cushion and are wide in the toe box so they don't rub my toe joint. These fit the bill. I purchased an Extra Wide: it is wider than any other running/walking shoe I have tried in the past. The shoes are very comfortable. I can put my orthotics in them. I plan to buy another pair. And thank you Zappos for your quick service and easy return policy.

What's good - It is far more comfortable, softer platform for the foot and it feels heavenly.  Sleeker look, nice response. It has a plusher feel similar to the Torin.

What's bad - Little to no arch support  They kept the guide rail and added a wrap-around tongue that is supposed to tighten as your arch needs it but I don't feel it.  It never seems to engage the way I think they meant it to.  In replace of this 'wrap-around tongue thingy,' they have removed the majority of stability support at the arch.  It's a good walking shoe but if you're wanting to run in these and you overpronate, I would be cautious.  You don't want to end up with a posterior tibial sprain."

The lightest shoe I've ever run in. However, I have runner's knee and I'm training for a marathon. The HOKA Bondi 6 is about 30% heavier than the Rincon (10.9 oz vs. 7.7 oz), but still doesn't feel ""heavy"" while running and has significantly more cushion for my knees. I was going to wear these Rincons for race day, but have decided to stick with the Bondi 6 for both training and racing.

I wear a Men's 9.5 in casual shoes and 10 in running shoes. These seemed a bit long for 10, but I fear a 9.5 may be too short. The Bondi 6 in 9.5 was too short, but the 10 was perfect. I would say the Rincons run 1/4 a size bigger than the Bondi 6."

Tried regular On Cloud in a store, and size 10 felt just a tad too tight, and 10.5 we maybe a tad too loose.
Ordered the On Cloud Waterproof in 10.5, and they were just right -- my guess is, due to an extra membrane layer, they are just a bit tighter than their non-waterproof counterpart.

Fit and finish are nothing short of stellar. 
Shoes are laced with an elastic string (not my cup of tea), but regular laces are included in the box.
I'd say the laces are on the shorter side, and definitely too short to lock the heel in (that is, to use all holes at the top of the shoe).

The shoes are very comfortable, but definitely a tad warm, which is to be expected as they are waterproof."

I have been a New Balance 990 guy for the last twenty or so years. I was ready to push the button here on v5 when a little more hipper spirit nudged me over to the Brooks' side of Zappos. 

While in Brooksville, I travelled to where the Adrenalines hang out.  They looked cool, light, comfy, and came in widths. I chose the stealth black 13 4E. 

I speed walk with my Labrador Retriever 6 miles a day and I'm happy to say I may be faster, certainly more comfortable, and obviously overjoyed in my selection. And yes, I'm coming back for more Adrenaline (Black / Lime and Black / Ketchup) ; one pair for my birthday, and one pair for Christmas.

I've been shopping at Zappos for about 10 years and, ladies and gentlemen, you have not let me down once. I actually look forward to returning shoes (wrong sizes) so I can hang with the customer service folks.

Thanks much for making this guy's shoe buying journey more enjoyable."

The shoes became unwearable due to blisters.  Not only that, the material near the laces wore out in about a month.  It was only an issue aesthetically, but once the heels wore down as well, this shoe became a disaster.  I only purchase Nike shoes, and I would not recommend this shoe if you want to keep the pair longer than 2 months."

While I like the original Levitate it didn’t offer some of the features this new model does that set it
apart from other models.  I typically have a tough time breaking in running shoes, dealing with blistering for the first few wears.  With the Levitate 2, the break-in period was non-existent
and I extended my first few runs in them, which I’ve never been able to do before.  I would consider myself an avid runner, but I plan to increase my running regiment based on the comfort 
of this shoe.  Much like the original, it’s lightweight and seems to work well with my flat feet.  Excited to see what additional color ways they plan to launch."

Just an fyi my brooks where a size 12 and these are a size 11.5 and the insole fit perfectly.  The issue with the insole was the lack of arch support.

I love how these shoes fit my feet like a glove. I normally wear a 9.5, that's the size I ordered, and that's the size I would stick with.

I chose the primer/ebony/black color combo and love how they look in person. I also love the woven material used in the shoe -- really cool texture and very breathable.

I used to wear Nike shoes almost exclusively (they do make great shoes), but I am now very much a Brooks fan. I highly recommend the Revel 3 (even if you're a walker and not a runner)."

I  held off buying the 9 because of all of the negative reviews.  Fortunately from my experience I think Brooks learned their lesson and made the Dyad 10 as comfortable as I remembered.... or at least close to it.  It felt a little snug when I initially put it on, but it fits nicely now.  I think it's a little lighter than what I was expecting.  There was only one color available when I ordered it.... not my usual preference, but it's grown on me.  I think it's going to hide dirt a lot better with this color scheme.

Apparently neutral to under-pronated, which is what I need as I have a suppinated stride.  Got these for walking as they have the curved heel that should aid in the rocking motion of walking.  Tried these for the first time and DOUBLED the length of my normal walk.  Light weight, especially compared to the all terrain shoes I'd been wearing which were nearly a full pound heavier as a pair, though still lightweight.
Good stability and excellent cushioning. Arch support is slight, and I need more, so use an insert. Was concerned this might cause heel slippage, but when laced through the rear most eyelets at the top, and laced fairly snuggly, it wasn't an issue.  Laces are also slightly stretchy, which is a plus.
Downsides are that Zappos only offers these in three fairly boring styles, black, black and grey, or black and white.  My first try was the black and white and I found that the white was very white and would likely get soiled pretty easily as I walk outdoors and my routes aren't over super clean areas.  They'd be fine for indoor use or if you're in an area of the country such as the south where sidewalks and streets are generally very clean with no dust or mud or other junk. And while the ""N"" logos on the shoes are super reflective for safety, as is a bit on the tongue, there is no reflective area on the rear of these, which is where reflective material is most important when walking or running after dark to alert cars that are coming upon you from your blind side. 
On the New Balance 990s I'd tried before these the upper part of the outer heel was a super reflective panel, which is great. With these, nothing.  A NB logo but not reflective. 
The fresh foam soles are bright white, and have dimples and little slits on a porous surface. This will likely mean they'll catch and hold dirt and they are fairly difficult to clean, requiring a tooth brush and a fair amount of work. Even then, I doubt I'll ever be able to keep them looking new, as they will inevitably trap dust and dirt with use. 
The 990s are built more traditionally with a solid padded heel, while these are the bootie style with a softer and slightly lower back part of the heel. 
Both are very comfortable, but the bootie style of these are a great sensation on your feet. Very snug, smooth, and comfortable fit and it is literally like wearing light slippers with a supportive and cushioned sole attached. Ventilation is excellent, though it also means that if you get the slightest splash of water on them, it goes right through to your socks and feet, as I found when walking through very shallow puddles on sidewalks after a snow melt.  But the upside is that they seem to dry very quickly. 
Everyone has different feet, different strides, and different needs for shoes, but for me these are great."

I was a big fan of the 5, but didn't care for the 6 - just didn't feel/fit right. I was hoping the 7 would capture the magic of the 5 and so far it does! Very excited about this.

the support and cushioning of the shoe is great mix and better than most everything i've tried in the past. now if i could just get some more exciting colors. they always seem a little too conservative. I would love something with a little more energy."

These shoes don't have the typical unattached tongue--it is attached to the sides of the shoe, so you can't just loosen the laces to insert your foot.

They do it in their Golf shoes. Also, the weird loose stap on the tounge make it extremely difficult to get the shoe on with out this loose strap bunching up. Very annoying."

The 990 is a legendary shoe, and the V5 has made subtle improvements. The arch and footbed support is improved over the V4. The tongue has much more padding. The side support is better. It might not be the sleekest runner ever, but it's a classic. I can spend the entire day in my 990's and my feet feel fresh.

Zappos and their customer service consistently blow me away. Same thing with my friends. There are a few companies that have fantastic customer service...Bose and T-Mobile come to mind, but Zappos is the standard."

I found the wider version of this shoe but what you get is a shoe that is about 1/4 inch longer but there's no real change in width and the section of the shoe that holds the laces will dig into the top of your foot because they are too long.  They also have great arch support but if you have high arches and your ankles turn outward (underpronate or supinate) they might make the problem worse.   The sole of this shoe is so comfortable and infact, my sister who has narrow feet and plantar fasciitis tried them on and ended up ordering her own pair and she loves them.  She no longer has pain in her feet and she has found she can stand for 8 hours at work and not have any issues any longer.   My two stars are for the width otherwise it's a great shoe."

I run 3-5 miles 3 times a week and these shoes have enough support for short distances like that. I really appreciate how light they are and almost forget I have them on when I’m finished a run. I appreciate the simplified lace pattern and thicker laces. No need to double tie like my last pair.

He is a bodybuilder type so used to wearing very flat trainer shoes but he’d had it with those shoes after the first 3 days of class. So I snuck these into our house and it took very little convincing for him to try them, which tells me he was in a world of hurt haha. Needless to say, his feet have been much happier the past two days. He said “well they don’t look as cool as my D-Maks but my feet don’t hurt.” There’s no way he would be caught dead in the bulkier Hokas but these are somewhat lower profile and subdued so they apparently pass LOL. (Other members of my family and I swear by Hokas for running and walking so we don’t have to be convinced!)"

So I measured his foot (10-3/4 inches) and ordered a basic pair for him.  According to the Vibram site his foot in inches equals a 44.  Low and behold its a perfect fit.  My husband is a D-E width with long toes. So after showing him how to get in the shoe, he loves them.  His gait is better, and walks better.  Now he trying to decide how to  wear them to work or anther pair of 5 fingers to work and get away with them.  This is his go to shoe now beside the V-Aqua which he wears for boating.   Just a great alternative for those who love the bare foot feeling."

I LOVED last year's Ghost 11s - I wear a 4E wide, and the Ghost 11s really felt perfect (particularly in the toe box).  With this Ghost 12, however, the shoes definitely feel narrower (particularly in the toe box) - not horribly tighter, but definitely snugger than the 11s (and maybe slightly shorter too).  So, I'm having to buy up the available 11s and hope that Brooks fixes things in a year with the 13s.  I also don't like the new design/look as much as the 11s."

apart from other models.  I typically have a tough time breaking in running shoes, dealing with blistering for the first few wears.  With the Levitate 2, the break-in period was non-existent
and I extended my first few runs in them, which I’ve never been able to do before.  I would consider myself an avid runner, but I plan to increase my running regiment based on the comfort 
of this shoe.  Much like the original, it’s lightweight and seems to work well with my flat feet.  Excited to see what additional color ways they plan to launch."

I have consistency been a ""12"" which they equate to a 47EU (which is nuts) - 12 is a 45EU. Anyways the 2.0 is def more snug and smaller.

It's tighter in the heel - which I like, but also very tight in the mid section. I had to go a half size up to tolerate wearing them for more than a few hours.

I don’t think I would necessarily use them for heavy-duty fitness activity as they aren’t really the most supportive shoes.  These are great casual shoes or walking shoes.  Feel more comfy than a slipper.

Two thoughts on sizing:
- I wear a size 9, which felt too small.  I bought a half-size up, which was perfect.  Also:
- I have a narrow foot (size 9, 3.7” width) and these were comfortable fit, but might be too narrow for a standard foot size (maybe order a full size up?) and definitely too narrow for a wide foot.  

Anyways, love these shoes and have purchased 3 pairs, so I can’t say enough good things about them.  Wish they had wide sizes so I could get a pair for my partner!!

Side note:  these are made with a knit material, so they aren’t very supportive, so if you need a lot of foot or ankle support, I would not try these shoes."

I love how these shoes fit my feet like a glove. I normally wear a 9.5, that's the size I ordered, and that's the size I would stick with.

I chose the primer/ebony/black color combo and love how they look in person. I also love the woven material used in the shoe -- really cool texture and very breathable.

I used to wear Nike shoes almost exclusively (they do make great shoes), but I am now very much a Brooks fan. I highly recommend the Revel 3 (even if you're a walker and not a runner)."

""Plush"" cushioning insoles really describes them well and arch support is quite adequate for my very flat feet. Wife and I easily cover 3 miles daily without fail and at this point they are holding up very well for a guy with a BMI of 24.

I didn't switch out or change the insoles, just kept the ones in that they came with. I think I'm going to stock up on these and might buy a few other Brooks sneakers. Thanks for changing my life!"

I wear a 9.5 EE in a Brooks Beast but my previous Hoka's were a 10 because a 9.5 was just too small so I opted up a half size. This pair isn't quite a perfect fit but a 9.5 would have been tight. As long as I wear socks, the Gaviota 2 works,  Width is good and walking around on these is a feel-good experience. Or perhaps I should write a feet-good experience.

I had the previous edition of the Kayano, and these feel equally supportive and a touch lighter.  For some reason they did seem to be a touch smaller than the previous version so I had to order a half-size up.  I have flat feet and always put in an extra arch support, but these shoes have a very nice amount of support for over-pronators.  My only complaint would be the lack of color options.  I wish there were as many choices as with previous versions, but the shoe itself seems as good or a touch better."

I generally wear shoes that are size 12 and wide width.  However, with my Asics running shoes, I have gone a little bigger, specifically 12.5 and 4E (versus EE).  Nonetheless, congruent with my previous experience with Asics, these GEL-Cumulus 21 running shoes are lightweight, stylish, and extremely comfortable.  I have continued to enjoy my regular runs.  Thus, I will continue to begin my searches for running shoes with the Asics brand."

That might be from the webbed design that this new model has over the older Clifton models. The toe box was also not right for me (too constricting) as well as strangely shaped inwards but for some reason, the length was ok. Odd. Zappos did not have a 12 1/2 so I bought that somewhere else. After three days of those Hoka Clifton 6's, I had to return them also since they literally destroyed my feet. My Plantar Fasciitis which I have not felt in 10 years of wearing Asics came back with a vengeance, as well as the slight Metatarsalgia that I have also forgotten about. This is due to the fore foot not having enough room to splay your toes correctly and not having any support for the Metatarsal region. I suppose the rocker mid sole that these shoe are known for are doing this. Bad design for me. I learned my lesson. I could only imagine if I put up with the discomfort any longer in order to ""break these in"". 

Also, these sneakers are advertised as ""neutral"" which is why I bought them in the first place but I found that the inner soles were slightly high as opposed to the outer parts of the soles that I was standing slightly uncomfortably bowed. I would NOT recommend these for anyone that has arch problems, Metatarsalgia, arthritis or Morton's Neuroma problems of any sort because these sneakers will only make those conditions much worse. They have absolutely no extra room to put your own orthotics in and only make the overall constricting feeling worse on your toes and arches.

I fell for the advertising. This new model is supposed to be the roomiest most comfortable of the whole Hoka One One line and I've seen some Foot Doctors actually recommending these because of the cushioning. The overall cushioning IS good I do admit, if that is what you are looking for, but Hoka is off my list for good."

Buying shoes that will allow me to comfortably go on my daily 8 - 10 mile walks has been challenging, to say the least. Holier-than-thou shoe experts swear that it is impossible to have both underpronation AND flat feet.  Thus, I was doomed to wear shoes that would help one issue but not the other. 

Until, by pure happenstance, I read an online article about the best running shoes for underpronation.  An honorable mention was given to the Saucony Echelon 7, with a notation that these were also great shoes for those with flat feet.  Eureka! Off to zappos.com I go.

So here I am. The Echelon 7s get very little love from Zappos customers but I think they're great.  I can go on extended walks and not feel like my spine is going to pierce through my neck.  It has been a very long time since I've had shoes that support my feet this well.  The styling is perfectly innocuous; there is nothing flashy about the Echelon 7s, which is something I greatly appreciate.

Criticisms? The overall cushioning could be better, but this is a very minor issue.  Overall, I am very pleased with these shoes."

The fit is tighter and not as comfortable as Rev-4, the angle of the foot is different and not as comfortable, and the sole looks more like a platform.

Now for the actual shoes. As I read while shopping around, I can confirm that these shoes are big, decently larger than normal running shoes. Due to that, they give off a “dad vibe” and I would never wear these other than for the purpose of running. The pictures I uploaded are compared to my 3 year old On Clouds for size comparison and you can see they are substantially larger. The toe box is wide which works for me because I feel I’m too wide for a regular shoe and too narrow for a wide shoe. I never buy anything other than normal width shoes size wide shoes are way too wide, and I often feel the side of my feet bunch against the side walls. These shoes are comfortable when running. The dual layer of clouds is nice if you’re a runner whose heel hits first as I do. No matter how much I try to alter, I always resort back to a natural heel, toe, heel, toe stride when running and my heels would hurt after runs of 5 miles or more. After a 5 mile run the other day, no heel pain. Since the shoe is bigger, you can notice the additional weight compared to other On shoes, and the back of the shoe rides higher up the heel. My heel was rubbed raw after my first run while wearing no show socks. During my second run, I wore low cut socks as opposed to no shows, and I didn’t tighten the top laces as tight and didn’t have an issue with the heel. I’m going to keep them but I will probably go back to the normal sized On shoes after I wear these out. I will update if anything changes."

I have consistency been a ""12"" which they equate to a 47EU (which is nuts) - 12 is a 45EU. Anyways the 2.0 is def more snug and smaller.

It's tighter in the heel - which I like, but also very tight in the mid section. I had to go a half size up to tolerate wearing them for more than a few hours. 

Beyond the ""fit"" they are still my go to travel and casual sneakers. I get a lot of compliments on them."

I am trying to get my feet in the habit of a lighter shoe as I'm trying to not make my shoe do all the heavy lifting. For my 3rd active running shoe I was looking for something that had a low drop, nice support/cushioning, and a low weight. This shoes hits all the checks mark. Plus it looks fresh and nice. These are my first pair of Hoka's and I think I'm going to come back to this brand in the future. Here's what I'm using each shoe for:
Hoka One One Rincon's: races/events of all distances. Half-marathon on under.
New Balance Fresh Foam Beacon's: Treadmill training and possible short races like 5K's
Brooks Ghost 11 - Recovery Runs, light jogs, or when my feet hurt."

Overall, good shoe, but slightly overpriced for the quality."

The Escalante is just about perfect for me. This is my third pair.
I like the new material in the uppers better than the open mesh of the earlier models -- sand pours in through the older mesh at the beach. If the new upper is a bit heavier for that, I can accept the trade-off.
I also like the low cushion in this model because I like to feel the ground as I run.  I do anticipate that the smoother tread pattern (vs. earlier model) will make it more difficult to see 'tread wear' patterns for analyzing gait symmetry, braking, and landing zones.  But it is less likely to pick up mud and grit that might get tracked into the house.  See photo for both tread pattern and typical grit.  Always trade offs."

These shoes make a minor swishing noise; 2. They fit tighter than standard On shoes.  

Noise: it’s minor and I am willing to accept it for a waterproof version of my favorite shoe.

Fit: I have the both the On and On 2.0 for comparison and this Waterproof model is tighter and the build is stiffer by comparison.  I solved it by switching to a thin merino wool sock and it’s perfect.  ALSO - they did break in a bit after wearing and the stiffness loosened up.

With Zappos’ awesome return policy, I ordered up a half size to try them.  I thought those would be too loose once broken in.  So ultimately I went with my standard size for On brand and the thinner sock.  

I love On shoes and after logging a few miles in these, I’m happy.  Hope this helps."

So out the door I went on my normal outdoor adventure for two hours.  Got a nasty heel blister, and I don't normally blister.  The back cuff material of the heel is quite stiff.  Much stiffer compared to the other shoes in the closet I rotate through.  Dang.  Is this why everyone says don't wear any shoe for that long on the first wear???  Whooops.  I think  I'm really going to like them, just a little confused what to do next.  Manually try to soften them up?  Was it my lacing?  Get different socks?"

I have problem with the joint of the big toes.  It is very hard to find shoes that have sufficient cushion and are wide in the toe box so they don't rub my toe joint. These fit the bill. I purchased an Extra Wide: it is wider than any other running/walking shoe I have tried in the past. The shoes are very comfortable. I can put my orthotics in them. I plan to buy another pair. And thank you Zappos for your quick service and easy return policy.

There is very little arch support in these, nor is there support (a “bump”) in the middle-front to open the toes a bit. That’s what my custom insoles do. Everyone’s feet are different, so why not allow for customized insoles? Just my two cents. Otherwise these would be great shoes."

I must say that these are just awesome, just awesome!!  When ! do Fitball, my feet in tennis shoes would slip in certain moves.  I needed something that would grip better on carpet.  I read the woman's reviews of this style for this purpose.  OMG, what a difference that made. The classic is now my go to shoe.  BTW, my foot measures 10-1/4 - 10-3/8 inches and I wear a C width. The men's 41 fit me perfectly vs. the ladies 42.  Ladies for those of you having a wide foot, try the men's version of the same shoe.  I wish that Vibram would make the straps on the woman's shoe longer or more forgiving for a wider foot."

The store gave me a deal because I was their only customer who could wear them. They were the only shoes I ever had that truly fit until the magic of online shopping allowed me to find such shoes again. Even so, they are few and far between. In fact, these are the first running shoes I’ve seen. I usually settle for B’s. I walk 5-7 miles a day on NYC sidewalks, so I need a good shoe. These fit the bill for that so far. I’ve only worn them for about 3 weeks. I’ll see how long they last, but my previous, cheaper pairs of New Balance have done well. I usually can get my 10.5 foot into an 11 NB B-width. These required a full size bigger. My foot fits like a glove. At first, I thought they were too narrow and then I removed the extra pair of socks that I always wear in all my other shoes. Perfect!  Gave style 4 stars only because I really wanted a pair of whites and I had a choice between black and black. I admit that I get tired of the NB logo, too. But I’m grateful to the company for filling a very small market niche. There are not a lot of men’s AA feet out there.  P.S. It’s a little thing. I’ve been double-tying running shoes for years because the furshligginer laces keep untying. These are hard to UNTIE when I double-tie them, but when I single-tie them, they usually stay tied. May their tribe increase."

Buying shoes that will allow me to comfortably go on my daily 8 - 10 mile walks has been challenging, to say the least. Holier-than-thou shoe experts swear that it is impossible to have both underpronation AND flat feet.  Thus, I was doomed to wear shoes that would help one issue but not the other. 

Until, by pure happenstance, I read an online article about the best running shoes for underpronation.  An honorable mention was given to the Saucony Echelon 7, with a notation that these were also great shoes for those with flat feet.  Eureka! Off to zappos.com I go.

So here I am. The Echelon 7s get very little love from Zappos customers but I think they're great.  I can go on extended walks and not feel like my spine is going to pierce through my neck.  It has been a very long time since I've had shoes that support my feet this well.  The styling is perfectly innocuous; there is nothing flashy about the Echelon 7s, which is something I greatly appreciate.

Criticisms? The overall cushioning could be better, but this is a very minor issue.  Overall, I am very pleased with these shoes."

This pair has a hole now (inner lining near the heel, exposing plastic), 4 months after purchase. They were not worn every day, maybe every other day for an hour or two. They should not wear out this quickly, but in my experience, all Hokas do wear out this quickly. The sole material also compresses pretty fast, making them much less cushy in just a few months. Overall, I still like these shoes because they are really comfortable, but I'm finding the value lacking. For $100-$150+, a shoe should last *at least* 6-8 months."

As soon as I put on my first pair of Altra shoes (which was actually a trail shoe - Timp), I new I had found my running shoe brand. Both the Timp and this shoe, Paradigm are the best damn running shoes I've owned. I've put in a lot of miles, sometimes running as much as 80-90 miles a week. I am getting more into Ultra distances these days, which is also a reason I am making this switch. The other running brands (IMO) really are not doing much for the trail runner. This shoe, if you do a lot of trail running, is a great compliment for when you do need your long road run..."

I have been a New Balance 990 guy for the last twenty or so years. I was ready to push the button here on v5 when a little more hipper spirit nudged me over to the Brooks' side of Zappos. 

While in Brooksville, I travelled to where the Adrenalines hang out.  They looked cool, light, comfy, and came in widths. I chose the stealth black 13 4E. 

I speed walk with my Labrador Retriever 6 miles a day and I'm happy to say I may be faster, certainly more comfortable, and obviously overjoyed in my selection. And yes, I'm coming back for more Adrenaline (Black / Lime and Black / Ketchup) ; one pair for my birthday, and one pair for Christmas.

I've been shopping at Zappos for about 10 years and, ladies and gentlemen, you have not let me down once. I actually look forward to returning shoes (wrong sizes) so I can hang with the customer service folks.

Thanks much for making this guy's shoe buying journey more enjoyable."

I have always had better luck with ASICS than with any other brand.  As a heavier runner, I find the levels of support and cushioning in the Kayano perfectly suited to my frame.  My only complaint is a petty one.  I wear a 4E width, and I am profoundly grateful to ASICS for manufacturing this top-tier shoe in my width.  I understand that the 4E market is very small, so it is unrealistic to ask for all color schemes to be available in 4E widths.   But I just wish that once in a while they would make the 4E width available in one of the more exciting color schemes.  Typically, the 4E width is only available in the blandest color scheme produced.  As I said, it is a petty complaint, and I can live with the bland colors as long as the shoes permit me to continue running injury-free."

Nonetheless, congruent with my previous experience with Asics, these GEL-Cumulus 21 running shoes are lightweight, stylish, and extremely comfortable.  I have continued to enjoy my regular runs.

The Escalante is just about perfect for me. This is my third pair.
I like the new material in the uppers better than the open mesh of the earlier models -- sand pours in through the older mesh at the beach. If the new upper is a bit heavier for that, I can accept the trade-off.
I also like the low cushion in this model because I like to feel the ground as I run.  I do anticipate that the smoother tread pattern (vs. earlier model) will make it more difficult to see 'tread wear' patterns for analyzing gait symmetry, braking, and landing zones.  But it is less likely to pick up mud and grit that might get tracked into the house.  See photo for both tread pattern and typical grit.  Always trade offs."

This pair has a hole now (inner lining near the heel, exposing plastic), 4 months after purchase. They were not worn every day, maybe every other day for an hour or two. They should not wear out this quickly, but in my experience, all Hokas do wear out this quickly. The sole material also compresses pretty fast, making them much less cushy in just a few months. Overall, I still like these shoes because they are really comfortable, but I'm finding the value lacking. For $100-$150+, a shoe should last *at least* 6-8 months."

They break in quickly, are incredibly comfortable and hold up better than 80% of the running shoes I've owned. I can say without hesitation that I've loved every pair. 

Until now. 

With this pair, the padded material at the top of the right shoe's Heel Counter caused a blister to form the first day I wore them. I figured it was break-in related and continued wearing them with adhesive blister protectors over my Achilles tendon for another week. It's been almost two months now and I still have to wear a blister protector at the top of my right heel when wearing these shoes. 

My luck with ON shoes has been great in the past so hopefully mine is an isolated problem. I still believe ON makes some of the best running shoes out there and I will continue to support the brand."

I love how these shoes fit my feet like a glove. I normally wear a 9.5, that's the size I ordered, and that's the size I would stick with.

I chose the primer/ebony/black color combo and love how they look in person. I also love the woven material used in the shoe -- really cool texture and very breathable.

I used to wear Nike shoes almost exclusively (they do make great shoes), but I am now very much a Brooks fan. I highly recommend the Revel 3 (even if you're a walker and not a runner)."

My only complaint is a petty one.  I wear a 4E width, and I am profoundly grateful to ASICS for manufacturing this top-tier shoe in my width.  I understand that the 4E market is very small, so it is unrealistic to ask for all color schemes to be available in 4E widths.   But I just wish that once in a while they would make the 4E width available in one of the more exciting color schemes.  Typically, the 4E width is only available in the blandest color scheme produced.

Cushioning was great, sung running shoe fit and a thin tongue which helps as not to bruise the top of your foot.

I really liked them but a good friend suggested I try the Hoka brand. Glad I did. These shoes with all the cushioning are still lighter than the Zooms.  I'm 70 years old and these shoes are just what I need to keep me on the trails.  One concern was that the extra layers would lead to wobbly ankle twists but no issues.  I'd buy another pair.
I did enjoy the Hoka website and shoe description of the different running shoes. I chose two that sounded like me and picked the Clifton 6."

I had the previous edition of the Kayano, and these feel equally supportive and a touch lighter.  For some reason they did seem to be a touch smaller than the previous version so I had to order a half-size up.  I have flat feet and always put in an extra arch support, but these shoes have a very nice amount of support for over-pronators.  My only complaint would be the lack of color options.  I wish there were as many choices as with previous versions, but the shoe itself seems as good or a touch better."

It gives room for my toes to naturally splay and feel comfortable without being pinched with a traditional tool box design. The heal I found to be too abrasive and snug. The lack of cushion and the stitching was uncomfortable. I wore my usual socks which are the Injinji brand and it was just too uncomfortable to wear. If there was more cushioning around the heel I would have enjoyed wearing the shoes more.

I’ve never had this issue with any other shoe before.

They also have great arch support but if you have high arches and your ankles turn outward (underpronate or supinate) they might make the problem worse.

Note: I work indoors and am on my feet and on the move pretty much all day, I do not use these to run in. I’d recommend these for running around town in. Like I said, a shoe with good lines and looks and pretty comfy in short bursts. Also I am 190 plus pounds, so that you have a weight reference."

My only complaint is a petty one.  I wear a 4E width, and I am profoundly grateful to ASICS for manufacturing this top-tier shoe in my width.  I understand that the 4E market is very small, so it is unrealistic to ask for all color schemes to be available in 4E widths.   But I just wish that once in a while they would make the 4E width available in one of the more exciting color schemes.  Typically, the 4E width is only available in the blandest color scheme produced.

First I should say that I am a devoted Altra user but I wanted to add some other brands to my roster.  I like the vongo because of its low drop (4mm).  So for me it was close to what Altra offers and I liked that.  But, here's the difference, New Balance has been around for a long long time and they have tried and true approaches and designs.   These shoes are amazing.  They were a little stiff the first time I wore them but after my first run they were completely broken in.  They have the perfect balance of firmness and softness in the soul.  They feel heavenly on my foot.  The fit is just right, not too tight and not too roomy.  I love them running in them, in fact, I cannot wait to get up in the morning so I can put them on.   I will continue to buy them every year."

I had been wearing the Bondi 5 but was constantly getting blisters on the insides of both feet.   I tried these on at a pre-race expo and liked how the felt so I gave them a shot.  I had trained in them for about a month before running a half marathon in them.   They were fantastic for the first 8-9 miles, but by mile 10 I had a horrendous hotfoot in the left shoe and really struggled to finish the race.  It could have been the laces being too tight, it could have been a bad sock choice, or maybe they just take a while to properly break in.   They feel much lighter and responsive than the Bondi, and I haven't given up on them yet, but if I can't race in them for more than a 10K I won't be buying another pair."

I wear women’s size 10.5 or 11 but have needed to move to men’s sizing for more room in the toe box. This version of adrenaline is not good, the toe box is narrow and there is no cushion. Last year I changed to ghost 11 womens 10.5 which was super comfortable but mid year the fit was changed to more narrow. This seems to be the trend with Brooks. The wide sizes, which are limited, are just too big in the heel and instep. I don’t understand who the running  shoe companies are targeting with all the narrow shoes on the market.

The shoe strings on these do not tie like normal shoes - you have to pull them with a bungee type cord. Once he figured them out, he liked them.  Thanks Nike and Zappos!

Now that they carry bigger sizes (17) I decided to try them again as I loved their jell soles in past. Moved from Medium width to wide for a little more box area. Have not worn a lot yet but extremely comfortable and great walking shoes. Will buy another pair once they get more into stock.  Very pleased.

Unfortunately, it looks like it is going away.  The GT-2000 8 Trail is about as close as I could get.  The fit is like the Kahana, with great support, good cushioning in the insole, snug overall fit.  I have a wider forefoot and this feels like the Kahana.  The tread on the outsole is grippy, but not quite as aggressive as the Kahana.  I think it will do well for me since the majority of the time I am not hiking rocky trails.  I like the style.  We'll see how it does on rocky trails, but so far, I am happy with it."

New Balance completely missed the mark on this one, especially for the price.  For starters the sole began to wear out after 3 or 4 jogs.  The added rubber sole inserts are completely worn down on the heel after only about a month of use and I alternated these shoes with 2 other pairs of Altras.  The worst part, however, are the insoles.  They are paper thin and do not stay in place even when casually walking around my house.  They ride back and gather behind my heels.  This past weekend I wore the shoes for a 3 mile walk and rubbed a blister on my right big toe due to the insole riding back and my toe rubbing on the edge of the insole and the bottom of the shoe.  

Lastly, the heel cup is very odd fitting and no matter which size shoe I tried, my heel slipped a bit.  Aside from looking good, these shoes are not worth it."

They felt great the second I put them on, and now that I have broken them in some, they feel even better.

I love how these shoes fit my feet like a glove. I normally wear a 9.5, that's the size I ordered, and that's the size I would stick with.

I used to wear Nike shoes almost exclusively (they do make great shoes), but I am now very much a Brooks fan. I highly recommend the Revel 3 (even if you're a walker and not a runner)."

This was noticeable when stationary but wasn't much of an issue when on the move. The new top gives a much more secure feel while still breathable. These would be great as running shoes but don't plan on using it as a daily 24/7 shoe. You may not notice that it is restricting your feet at first but after half an hour or longer, you'll want to take them off to let your feet spay out. This feels more like a normal shoe with zero drop rather than the large open toe box of Altra. I have fairly narrow feet also, which makes me think it would be even worse for most people. Sizing up half a size may fix this but may also cause other issues such as heel slippage. The heel in the back does go up higher. This will probably give more secure fit but it also rubs a bit more than the 1.5 did. The midsole is a little more firm, which I actually preferred. It won't have as soft on initial feel but I think it provides better comfort/support beyond the initial 15 mins. The bottom has more foam removed for areas that would bend to give it more flexibility but the rubber sole has basically no threads. It is very slippery on wet and smooth surfaces. My year olf 1.5s had better grip than these 2.0 brand new. Overall, I am disappointed with the revision. On initial try, I thought this would be my new favorite shoe as it felt much more secure than the 1.5 did. The restrictive top material on the toebox was the deal breaker for me. These no longer feel like Altras as my toes felt squished together."

I have been running in Nike Pegasus road shoes pretty much since the 1980s (with some interludes trying out other brands), so I knew that this trail version would fit similarly.  I took these for a spin on the trails two days in a row and they didn't really require any breaking in, probably because I am already familiar with the platform and ride of the road version.  They felt light and responsive, so I can imagine that they will be good to race in as well.  I can't speak to their durability at this point, nor can I evaluate how effective they are in particularly rugged (or muddy) conditions.  But for general running around twisty, rooty trails in the woods of North Carolina, they are great!  I like the color choices, too."

This pair has a hole now (inner lining near the heel, exposing plastic), 4 months after purchase. They were not worn every day, maybe every other day for an hour or two. They should not wear out this quickly, but in my experience, all Hokas do wear out this quickly. The sole material also compresses pretty fast, making them much less cushy in just a few months. Overall, I still like these shoes because they are really comfortable, but I'm finding the value lacking. For $100-$150+, a shoe should last *at least* 6-8 months."

I have always had better luck with ASICS than with any other brand.  As a heavier runner, I find the levels of support and cushioning in the Kayano perfectly suited to my frame.  My only complaint is a petty one.  I wear a 4E width, and I am profoundly grateful to ASICS for manufacturing this top-tier shoe in my width.  I understand that the 4E market is very small, so it is unrealistic to ask for all color schemes to be available in 4E widths.   But I just wish that once in a while they would make the 4E width available in one of the more exciting color schemes.  Typically, the 4E width is only available in the blandest color scheme produced.  As I said, it is a petty complaint, and I can live with the bland colors as long as the shoes permit me to continue running injury-free."

This was noticeable when stationary but wasn't much of an issue when on the move. The new top gives a much more secure feel while still breathable. These would be great as running shoes but don't plan on using it as a daily 24/7 shoe. You may not notice that it is restricting your feet at first but after half an hour or longer, you'll want to take them off to let your feet spay out. This feels more like a normal shoe with zero drop rather than the large open toe box of Altra. I have fairly narrow feet also, which makes me think it would be even worse for most people. Sizing up half a size may fix this but may also cause other issues such as heel slippage. The heel in the back does go up higher. This will probably give more secure fit but it also rubs a bit more than the 1.5 did. The midsole is a little more firm, which I actually preferred. It won't have as soft on initial feel but I think it provides better comfort/support beyond the initial 15 mins. The bottom has more foam removed for areas that would bend to give it more flexibility but the rubber sole has basically no threads. It is very slippery on wet and smooth surfaces. My year olf 1.5s had better grip than these 2.0 brand new. Overall, I am disappointed with the revision. On initial try, I thought this would be my new favorite shoe as it felt much more secure than the 1.5 did. The restrictive top material on the toebox was the deal breaker for me. These no longer feel like Altras as my toes felt squished together."

New Balance completely missed the mark on this one, especially for the price.  For starters the sole began to wear out after 3 or 4 jogs.  The added rubber sole inserts are completely worn down on the heel after only about a month of use and I alternated these shoes with 2 other pairs of Altras.  The worst part, however, are the insoles.  They are paper thin and do not stay in place even when casually walking around my house.  They ride back and gather behind my heels.  This past weekend I wore the shoes for a 3 mile walk and rubbed a blister on my right big toe due to the insole riding back and my toe rubbing on the edge of the insole and the bottom of the shoe.  

Lastly, the heel cup is very odd fitting and no matter which size shoe I tried, my heel slipped a bit.  Aside from looking good, these shoes are not worth it."

What's good - It is far more comfortable, softer platform for the foot and it feels heavenly.  Sleeker look, nice response. It has a plusher feel similar to the Torin.

What's bad - Little to no arch support  They kept the guide rail and added a wrap-around tongue that is supposed to tighten as your arch needs it but I don't feel it.  It never seems to engage the way I think they meant it to.  In replace of this 'wrap-around tongue thingy,' they have removed the majority of stability support at the arch.  It's a good walking shoe but if you're wanting to run in these and you overpronate, I would be cautious.  You don't want to end up with a posterior tibial sprain."

Nike keeps changing the model number.  The Revolution 4 shoe was perfect to size, comfort, weight, and style. Apparently the Rev-4 is being phased out based on the remaining 3 pathetic colors that remain in Zappo inventory. This leads to the Rev-5.  It is different enough to irritate me.  The fit is tighter and not as comfortable as Rev-4, the angle of the foot is different and not as comfortable, and the sole looks more like a platform.  I will keep these, but I wish they would stop the racket of obsolescence just so they can offer a new shoe at a higher price."

apart from other models.  I typically have a tough time breaking in running shoes, dealing with blistering for the first few wears.  With the Levitate 2, the break-in period was non-existent
and I extended my first few runs in them, which I’ve never been able to do before.  I would consider myself an avid runner, but I plan to increase my running regiment based on the comfort 
of this shoe.  Much like the original, it’s lightweight and seems to work well with my flat feet.  Excited to see what additional color ways they plan to launch."

New Balance completely missed the mark on this one, especially for the price.  For starters the sole began to wear out after 3 or 4 jogs.  The added rubber sole inserts are completely worn down on the heel after only about a month of use and I alternated these shoes with 2 other pairs of Altras.  The worst part, however, are the insoles.  They are paper thin and do not stay in place even when casually walking around my house.  They ride back and gather behind my heels.  This past weekend I wore the shoes for a 3 mile walk and rubbed a blister on my right big toe due to the insole riding back and my toe rubbing on the edge of the insole and the bottom of the shoe.  

Lastly, the heel cup is very odd fitting and no matter which size shoe I tried, my heel slipped a bit.  Aside from looking good, these shoes are not worth it."

I wear women’s size 10.5 or 11 but have needed to move to men’s sizing for more room in the toe box. This version of adrenaline is not good, the toe box is narrow and there is no cushion. Last year I changed to ghost 11 womens 10.5 which was super comfortable but mid year the fit was changed to more narrow. This seems to be the trend with Brooks. The wide sizes, which are limited, are just too big in the heel and instep. I don’t understand who the running  shoe companies are targeting with all the narrow shoes on the market.

The fit is tighter and not as comfortable as Rev-4, the angle of the foot is different and not as comfortable, and the sole looks more like a platform.

I like basic black and decided to try the mens version and I am usually an 8 1/2 size but tried on the 7 1/2 in the Mens style and they fit perfectly. These sneakers are very comfortable from the second i put them on. I wear orthotics and removed the liner that came with the sneaker and put in my orthotic and it fit perfectly. There is cushion in these sneakers and I like that and they are pretty stylish in the basic black color. I work at a hospital for 8 plus hours per day, on my feet all day and these sneakers are great. So any woman who wants to the mens version just go down *one size* from the womens and these will fit perfectly."

The cushioning is just the right amount for those long easy runs. The upper fits comfortably and the breathability is what can be expected from this type of material. The only down size is the Heel Collar. The way the stitch is made rubbed against my Achilles and created a blister after my first run. Granted I run in low show socks so from now on I will wear a longer sock with this show.

What's good - It is far more comfortable, softer platform for the foot and it feels heavenly.  Sleeker look, nice response. It has a plusher feel similar to the Torin.

What's bad - Little to no arch support  They kept the guide rail and added a wrap-around tongue that is supposed to tighten as your arch needs it but I don't feel it.  It never seems to engage the way I think they meant it to.  In replace of this 'wrap-around tongue thingy,' they have removed the majority of stability support at the arch.  It's a good walking shoe but if you're wanting to run in these and you overpronate, I would be cautious.  You don't want to end up with a posterior tibial sprain."

I found the wider version of this shoe but what you get is a shoe that is about 1/4 inch longer but there's no real change in width and the section of the shoe that holds the laces will dig into the top of your foot because they are too long.  They also have great arch support but if you have high arches and your ankles turn outward (underpronate or supinate) they might make the problem worse.   The sole of this shoe is so comfortable and infact, my sister who has narrow feet and plantar fasciitis tried them on and ended up ordering her own pair and she loves them.  She no longer has pain in her feet and she has found she can stand for 8 hours at work and not have any issues any longer.   My two stars are for the width otherwise it's a great shoe."

What's good - It is far more comfortable, softer platform for the foot and it feels heavenly.  Sleeker look, nice response. It has a plusher feel similar to the Torin.

What's bad - Little to no arch support  They kept the guide rail and added a wrap-around tongue that is supposed to tighten as your arch needs it but I don't feel it.  It never seems to engage the way I think they meant it to.  In replace of this 'wrap-around tongue thingy,' they have removed the majority of stability support at the arch.  It's a good walking shoe but if you're wanting to run in these and you overpronate, I would be cautious.  You don't want to end up with a posterior tibial sprain."

I purchased and ultimately returned after a couple runs. I REALLY wanted to keep them but couldn’t because of 2-3 problems. Will I purchase the Duo 2+?, yes and hope for the best.

1. As mentioned in reviews from multiple sites, there is a problem with the tongue. As patient as I was willing to be to get the tongue seated after putting the shoe on my foot, I couldn’t see spending 10 minutes every time to put them on, but I loved the idea of having that cushion on long runs as I hope to build back up to marathons & ultras in the next year.

2. I have the Torin 4. Amazing shoe. I consider it my ‘race’ shoe, but wanted a training shoe for my aging 45 yr old body-thus the Duo1.5. They are two completely different cuts. Compare the pictures. The Duo hurt the width of my foot, not my toes, after a couple miles despite adjustments to the laces during the jogs and even re-lacing to try and allow the shoe to let my foot spread so-to-speak.

3. The tongue & upper in the pair I had was simply shoddy construction with choppy long pieces left attached above your toes. 

4. It was just ever so slightly loose in the heel, but with adjustments, I could seat my heel. 

There are still some really nice and interesting qualities of the shoe:
A. The sole was substantial! And would really grab the surfaces. Wow! I actually thought I may not run through the sole.
B. The weird thing about the mesh upper outlined with flat rubber edging(?) is it locked your foot and into the shoe. I could see potential for the shoe could completely disappear from thought as you run in them. It like it could be a second skin and might feel great sock-less. I’m a sock guy. 
C. The midsole was wonderful. Straight up comfy cushion. 

Hope this helps."

The fit is great, and not a huge change from previous versions. Toe box and width are pretty generous. Lots of stretch in the materials helps provide a solid yet flexible fit.

Cushioning is awesome. Most brands charge more of a premium for a ride this plush. Very comfortable for short and mid distance runs.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a comfortable plush daily trainer."

I wear women’s size 10.5 or 11 but have needed to move to men’s sizing for more room in the toe box. This version of adrenaline is not good, the toe box is narrow and there is no cushion. Last year I changed to ghost 11 womens 10.5 which was super comfortable but mid year the fit was changed to more narrow. This seems to be the trend with Brooks. The wide sizes, which are limited, are just too big in the heel and instep. I don’t understand who the running  shoe companies are targeting with all the narrow shoes on the market.

I bumped up my daily walk from 5 to 8 miles a day (I try to walk a sub 15 minute mile consistently). I had ordered some Adidas trail shoes and although they were nice they were heavy and not good for the walking that I’m doing. I received my Nova Flows and put them to the test and they were great. Cushioning was great, sung running shoe fit and a thin tongue which helps as not to bruise the top of your foot. I like these so much I’m considering buying an identical pair for when I wear them out, because at this point no one knows when we’re going back to a normal life. But seriously, I’d recommend these shoes. Stay safe ?"

I have been a New Balance 990 guy for the last twenty or so years. I was ready to push the button here on v5 when a little more hipper spirit nudged me over to the Brooks' side of Zappos. 

While in Brooksville, I travelled to where the Adrenalines hang out.  They looked cool, light, comfy, and came in widths. I chose the stealth black 13 4E. 

I speed walk with my Labrador Retriever 6 miles a day and I'm happy to say I may be faster, certainly more comfortable, and obviously overjoyed in my selection. And yes, I'm coming back for more Adrenaline (Black / Lime and Black / Ketchup) ; one pair for my birthday, and one pair for Christmas.

I've been shopping at Zappos for about 10 years and, ladies and gentlemen, you have not let me down once. I actually look forward to returning shoes (wrong sizes) so I can hang with the customer service folks.

Thanks much for making this guy's shoe buying journey more enjoyable."

If you wear 4E wide shoes, pick something like Asics, or New Balance, especially the latter, as they specialize in people with wide feet.

This shoe felt more like a 2E than a 4E, i did everything possible (without) stretching the shoe to 'break it in' nothing worked. Me feet just hurt really badly, so I'm returning them.

I just purchased a New Balance 680, and the first day, it just fits... No pain, just pure comfort."

This pair has a hole now (inner lining near the heel, exposing plastic), 4 months after purchase. They were not worn every day, maybe every other day for an hour or two. They should not wear out this quickly, but in my experience, all Hokas do wear out this quickly. The sole material also compresses pretty fast, making them much less cushy in just a few months. Overall, I still like these shoes because they are really comfortable, but I'm finding the value lacking. For $100-$150+, a shoe should last *at least* 6-8 months."

I chose the primer/ebony/black color combo and love how they look in person. I also love the woven material used in the shoe -- really cool texture and very breathable.

I used to wear Nike shoes almost exclusively (they do make great shoes), but I am now very much a Brooks fan. I highly recommend the Revel 3 (even if you're a walker and not a runner)."

This v3 is by far the WORST so far and a definite step backwards by NB - if Zappos has an old dusty box of v2 13EE's lying around, I'd gladly trade for them. As others have said, while the width when you look at the shoe inserts is about the same, and the length actually appears to be slightly longer, the fit is definitely tighter, meaning the vertical size of the interior must be smaller. Whoever the marketing genius is that decided to ""improve"" this model version should be fired, or at least forced to wear these damn shoes. The stability still seems as good as before but every other aspect of this shoe is worse than before. The tongue is too short, the heal height is too short, and even the freaking the laces are too short. I've been wearing this pair, hoping they would break in better, so can't really return them, but I now need to search beyond New Balance for good shoes."

I love how these shoes fit my feet like a glove. I normally wear a 9.5, that's the size I ordered, and that's the size I would stick with.

I chose the primer/ebony/black color combo and love how they look in person. I also love the woven material used in the shoe -- really cool texture and very breathable.

I used to wear Nike shoes almost exclusively (they do make great shoes), but I am now very much a Brooks fan. I highly recommend the Revel 3 (even if you're a walker and not a runner)."

It felt slightly short so I sized up a half size. This is the lightest shoe in my arsenal of running shoes. The upper is SUPER breathable, you can see your socks through the mesh which is kind of fun."

Really lightweight and a great shoe, so I was disappointed that the snug fit at the heel caused the discomfort."

The lightest shoe I've ever run in. However, I have runner's knee and I'm training for a marathon. The HOKA Bondi 6 is about 30% heavier than the Rincon (10.9 oz vs. 7.7 oz), but still doesn't feel ""heavy"" while running and has significantly more cushion for my knees. I was going to wear these Rincons for race day, but have decided to stick with the Bondi 6 for both training and racing.

I wear a Men's 9.5 in casual shoes and 10 in running shoes. These seemed a bit long for 10, but I fear a 9.5 may be too short. The Bondi 6 in 9.5 was too short, but the 10 was perfect. I would say the Rincons run 1/4 a size bigger than the Bondi 6."

I love how these shoes fit my feet like a glove. I normally wear a 9.5, that's the size I ordered, and that's the size I would stick with.

I chose the primer/ebony/black color combo and love how they look in person. I also love the woven material used in the shoe -- really cool texture and very breathable.

I used to wear Nike shoes almost exclusively (they do make great shoes), but I am now very much a Brooks fan. I highly recommend the Revel 3 (even if you're a walker and not a runner)."

I ordered my husband a pair in size 11 which is the size he typically wears in Adidas, and they were huge! Ordered a 10.5, and the length was still too long. He opted not to order another pair even smaller because even though the length was so long, the opening to insert his foot was quite small and tight. These shoes don't have the typical unattached tongue--it is attached to the sides of the shoe, so you can't just loosen the laces to insert your foot. Loved the style and color, but could not make it work."

I bought these shoes right before Christmas and have worn them everyday since purchase. I no longer have pain in my foot/heel. It's a miracle! I didn't switch out or change the insoles, just kept the ones in that they came with. I think I'm going to stock up on these and might buy a few other Brooks sneakers. Thanks for changing my life!"

I normally order New Balance but thought I'd try the UA and I am very pleased. They are more comfortable than than many of the NB I've purchased in the past.  My arch is also very high and these nearly fit it which is very rare.  The only thing I would change on these is the color. I would prefer either a different color or more design with more colors.  I am definitely recommending these shoes!

I wear Saucony running shoes all the time, but this year they have no model with my needed specs.  I've bought Skecher Performance shoes for casual style, ten dollars cheaper and actually excellent quality for the price.  I assumed Saucony's economy style line would still have some kind of Saucony-level of quality.  They're nice looking, but with WalMart shoe quality.  These are sold as running shoes, but I can't imagine anyone running in them.  It was uncomfortable just to stand in them.  While the shoe fits with room to spare, the midsole is flat and narrow.  Almost no cushioning in the heel.  I have Clarks leather loafers that are more comfortable to stand in."

This pair has a hole now (inner lining near the heel, exposing plastic), 4 months after purchase. They were not worn every day, maybe every other day for an hour or two. They should not wear out this quickly, but in my experience, all Hokas do wear out this quickly. The sole material also compresses pretty fast, making them much less cushy in just a few months. Overall, I still like these shoes because they are really comfortable, but I'm finding the value lacking. For $100-$150+, a shoe should last *at least* 6-8 months."

The tongue is too short like everyone else says. The heels are a little weak so I might not be able to slip these one sometime like other quality sturdy shoes. There is a little extra room around the toes. I don't this this will bother me, the room is there if you need it. 

So the heal area is cheapened and weakened a little with the mesh outer.   Some bean counter probley Oked to small tongue too.  Then they plaster Made in the USA all over these. Give me a break! You keep cheaping these shoes that you want a FORTUNE FOR.  They is no noticeable technology about this shoe. The footbed has good support and is wide but there is nothing spectacular about the insole softness.   You could get away with some $60 Sketchers.   I also buy very expensive Clarks and other high quality shoes. 

I am keeping them because of other statements about foot support but that is the only reason. I dont mind paying for a quality shoe but these dont impress me."

The Escalante is just about perfect for me. This is my third pair.
I like the new material in the uppers better than the open mesh of the earlier models -- sand pours in through the older mesh at the beach. If the new upper is a bit heavier for that, I can accept the trade-off.
I also like the low cushion in this model because I like to feel the ground as I run.  I do anticipate that the smoother tread pattern (vs. earlier model) will make it more difficult to see 'tread wear' patterns for analyzing gait symmetry, braking, and landing zones.  But it is less likely to pick up mud and grit that might get tracked into the house.  See photo for both tread pattern and typical grit.  Always trade offs."

I bought these shoes right before Christmas and have worn them everyday since purchase. I no longer have pain in my foot/heel. It's a miracle! I didn't switch out or change the insoles, just kept the ones in that they came with. I think I'm going to stock up on these and might buy a few other Brooks sneakers. Thanks for changing my life!"

Buying shoes that will allow me to comfortably go on my daily 8 - 10 mile walks has been challenging, to say the least. Holier-than-thou shoe experts swear that it is impossible to have both underpronation AND flat feet.  Thus, I was doomed to wear shoes that would help one issue but not the other. 

Until, by pure happenstance, I read an online article about the best running shoes for underpronation.  An honorable mention was given to the Saucony Echelon 7, with a notation that these were also great shoes for those with flat feet.  Eureka! Off to zappos.com I go.

So here I am. The Echelon 7s get very little love from Zappos customers but I think they're great.  I can go on extended walks and not feel like my spine is going to pierce through my neck.  It has been a very long time since I've had shoes that support my feet this well.  The styling is perfectly innocuous; there is nothing flashy about the Echelon 7s, which is something I greatly appreciate.

Criticisms? The overall cushioning could be better, but this is a very minor issue.  Overall, I am very pleased with these shoes."

The Escalante is just about perfect for me. This is my third pair.
I like the new material in the uppers better than the open mesh of the earlier models -- sand pours in through the older mesh at the beach. If the new upper is a bit heavier for that, I can accept the trade-off.
I also like the low cushion in this model because I like to feel the ground as I run.  I do anticipate that the smoother tread pattern (vs. earlier model) will make it more difficult to see 'tread wear' patterns for analyzing gait symmetry, braking, and landing zones.  But it is less likely to pick up mud and grit that might get tracked into the house.  See photo for both tread pattern and typical grit.  Always trade offs."

They were fantastic for the first 8-9 miles, but by mile 10 I had a horrendous hotfoot in the left shoe and really struggled to finish the race.

(I'm a 12-B in New Balance walking shoes, but have been a 12.5-B in the Brooks Addiction.)

That half-size-up approach also worked well for the Addiction 12 and the Addiction 13, but not for the Addiction 14. Its footbed seems longer at the same size as the 11/12/13. My test, aside from noticing that my heel was slipping up more than in the earlier models, was to slide my orthotic around inside the 14. There's definitely more room for the orthotic insert front-to-back in the 14 than in the 13. 

I've exchanged the Addiction 14 for one a half-size smaller, which should be about right. Excellent service on the advance exchange from Zappos, too."

I wore them running for a couple of days and was so impressed with them, that I bought a second pair; different color (white). the fact that I ordered two pairs of the same shoe(s) in one week pretty much sums up my feelings for these shoes. Typically, I wear Hoka One One shoes. For some reason,( probably the pretty yellow color available), I decided to give these New Balance a try. They don't have the same support as Hokas, but they are still a great shoes  for middle distance running; Hoka shoes (my opinion) are better for long distance running. If you are a 5 or 10k runner, these new Balance 1500v6 are great shoes. If you are running anything over a 10K, I would recommend Hoka One One shoes. By the way, the yellow color and the white color for these particular shoes (NB 1500v6) are super beautiful colors. I wish more shoes were available in yellow"

As long as I wear socks, the Gaviota 2 works,  Width is good and walking around on these is a feel-good experience. Or perhaps I should write a feet-good experience.

Cloud X is probably one of the lightest shoes I’ve ever worn (~8oz or so) - this comes with with trade offs:
Pro: light, does not get in the way of running and with other activities; cushion has the same cloud tech that makes it great for running with heel support
Cons: not the best for a heavy rainy day; not the best in an area with a lot uneven surfaces (ie trail running); general protection from injury is weak due to the lightness of the shoe

2. Other details
-only comes with regular shoelaces (no spandex laces like some of the other ON models)
-the back of the shoe is extremely thin, but comfortable
-would not recommend for exercises like weightlifting where you might need more ankle support for heavier lifts
-recommend for runs, sprints(HIIT), and rowing (turns out the limited support on the back of the shoe also does not tug at skin as hard as a well supported back)

Hope this is helpful!"

I have been a New Balance 990 guy for the last twenty or so years. I was ready to push the button here on v5 when a little more hipper spirit nudged me over to the Brooks' side of Zappos. 

While in Brooksville, I travelled to where the Adrenalines hang out.  They looked cool, light, comfy, and came in widths. I chose the stealth black 13 4E. 

I speed walk with my Labrador Retriever 6 miles a day and I'm happy to say I may be faster, certainly more comfortable, and obviously overjoyed in my selection. And yes, I'm coming back for more Adrenaline (Black / Lime and Black / Ketchup) ; one pair for my birthday, and one pair for Christmas.

I've been shopping at Zappos for about 10 years and, ladies and gentlemen, you have not let me down once. I actually look forward to returning shoes (wrong sizes) so I can hang with the customer service folks.

Thanks much for making this guy's shoe buying journey more enjoyable."

Nike keeps changing the model number.  The Revolution 4 shoe was perfect to size, comfort, weight, and style. Apparently the Rev-4 is being phased out based on the remaining 3 pathetic colors that remain in Zappo inventory. This leads to the Rev-5.  It is different enough to irritate me.  The fit is tighter and not as comfortable as Rev-4, the angle of the foot is different and not as comfortable, and the sole looks more like a platform.  I will keep these, but I wish they would stop the racket of obsolescence just so they can offer a new shoe at a higher price."

My purpose in buying this shoe was for recumbent cycling (3 wheel). Since my toes are somewhat hammered resulting in uncomfortable pressure when biking or walking. I also have a wide foot so I ordered size 11.5 - 4X width. These shoes were the solution to a nagging problem and have proven after multiple uses that I made the right decision. They are light yet hold my feet firmly in place when I ride. I am extremely happy with these shoes.

The upper needs a few miles to break in and loosen up up it's smooth after that.  The toe box is very wide but doesn't look silly like past Altras.  Super cushioned yet pretty flexible. I sized down a 1/2 size compared to my Brooks and Kinvara.  I suggest going with a smaller choice if you're between sizes.

In the past year I developed some heel pain and Achilles tendonitis, particularly in the right foot.  I never dreamed of buying a pair of these modified walking boots (my nickname for them), but I tried them on in a store, and just had to have them.  The plan was to use them for my long outdoor runs to help remedy my foot problem.  Super plush, lots of underfoot protection.  Not the fastest shoe, since this level of cushioning bleeds off your thrust and efficiency, but they are super light.  Most importantly, I can finish a 10-12 mile run in these, and my feet still feel pretty fresh.  Very well protected.  Working these into my shoe rotation has helped me recover enough that my weekly mileage has returned to what it was over a year ago.  Not the most attractive shoe with that thick slab of foam, but running in them has a therapeutic quality to it.  Super comfortable ride."

The cushioning is just the right amount for those long easy runs. The upper fits comfortably and the breathability is what can be expected from this type of material. The only down size is the Heel Collar. The way the stitch is made rubbed against my Achilles and created a blister after my first run. Granted I run in low show socks so from now on I will wear a longer sock with this show.

I LOVED last year's Ghost 11s - I wear a 4E wide, and the Ghost 11s really felt perfect (particularly in the toe box).  With this Ghost 12, however, the shoes definitely feel narrower (particularly in the toe box) - not horribly tighter, but definitely snugger than the 11s (and maybe slightly shorter too).  So, I'm having to buy up the available 11s and hope that Brooks fixes things in a year with the 13s.  I also don't like the new design/look as much as the 11s."

Now for the actual shoes. As I read while shopping around, I can confirm that these shoes are big, decently larger than normal running shoes. Due to that, they give off a “dad vibe” and I would never wear these other than for the purpose of running. The pictures I uploaded are compared to my 3 year old On Clouds for size comparison and you can see they are substantially larger. The toe box is wide which works for me because I feel I’m too wide for a regular shoe and too narrow for a wide shoe. I never buy anything other than normal width shoes size wide shoes are way too wide, and I often feel the side of my feet bunch against the side walls. These shoes are comfortable when running. The dual layer of clouds is nice if you’re a runner whose heel hits first as I do. No matter how much I try to alter, I always resort back to a natural heel, toe, heel, toe stride when running and my heels would hurt after runs of 5 miles or more. After a 5 mile run the other day, no heel pain. Since the shoe is bigger, you can notice the additional weight compared to other On shoes, and the back of the shoe rides higher up the heel. My heel was rubbed raw after my first run while wearing no show socks. During my second run, I wore low cut socks as opposed to no shows, and I didn’t tighten the top laces as tight and didn’t have an issue with the heel. I’m going to keep them but I will probably go back to the normal sized On shoes after I wear these out. I will update if anything changes."

I contacted them to get a cold response and wait 14 days for them busy running folks to stroll onto a response. Then I get the old, read our faqs sorry and you can't return them but you can get a discount for 50% off the next pair.

I have been a New Balance 990 guy for the last twenty or so years. I was ready to push the button here on v5 when a little more hipper spirit nudged me over to the Brooks' side of Zappos. 

While in Brooksville, I travelled to where the Adrenalines hang out.  They looked cool, light, comfy, and came in widths. I chose the stealth black 13 4E. 

I speed walk with my Labrador Retriever 6 miles a day and I'm happy to say I may be faster, certainly more comfortable, and obviously overjoyed in my selection. And yes, I'm coming back for more Adrenaline (Black / Lime and Black / Ketchup) ; one pair for my birthday, and one pair for Christmas.

I've been shopping at Zappos for about 10 years and, ladies and gentlemen, you have not let me down once. I actually look forward to returning shoes (wrong sizes) so I can hang with the customer service folks.

Thanks much for making this guy's shoe buying journey more enjoyable."

It's tighter in the heel - which I like, but also very tight in the mid section. I had to go a half size up to tolerate wearing them for more than a few hours.

I have been a New Balance 990 guy for the last twenty or so years. I was ready to push the button here on v5 when a little more hipper spirit nudged me over to the Brooks' side of Zappos. 

While in Brooksville, I travelled to where the Adrenalines hang out.  They looked cool, light, comfy, and came in widths. I chose the stealth black 13 4E. 

I speed walk with my Labrador Retriever 6 miles a day and I'm happy to say I may be faster, certainly more comfortable, and obviously overjoyed in my selection. And yes, I'm coming back for more Adrenaline (Black / Lime and Black / Ketchup) ; one pair for my birthday, and one pair for Christmas.

I've been shopping at Zappos for about 10 years and, ladies and gentlemen, you have not let me down once. I actually look forward to returning shoes (wrong sizes) so I can hang with the customer service folks.

Thanks much for making this guy's shoe buying journey more enjoyable."

I've never owned a pair of Under Armor shoes before, and these won't be the last. I love them.

They are a handsome design and have ample support behind the heel, beneath the arch and are well balanced for everyday use.

The synthetic upper is tough and feels durable while the grip of the sole is fine for wet conditions. A winner from every angle."

I ordered my husband a pair in size 11 which is the size he typically wears in Adidas, and they were huge! Ordered a 10.5, and the length was still too long. He opted not to order another pair even smaller because even though the length was so long, the opening to insert his foot was quite small and tight. These shoes don't have the typical unattached tongue--it is attached to the sides of the shoe, so you can't just loosen the laces to insert your foot.

The Horizon Wave 3 is the best model since the Alchemy 11. Over the past several years I have run in the Paradox line. The Paradox 2 and 3 were good/ok but they were no match for the Alchemy series. The Horizon Wave 3 reminds me why I started running in Mizuno shoes years ago. It provides great stability and, in combination with Aetrec orthothic inserts, is plush and very cushioned. The fit is true to size. It has a wide toe box and the Mizuno X10 carbon rubber outsole has proven to be very durable.

Like all Altras, these are zero drop; if you are not used to it, take your time to transition - your Achilles will thank you. Also, they have minimal cushioning, so proper running form is absolutely required. With that out of the way...

These shoes are awesome. Light, fast, comfortable. I'm completely in love with them. I'm an avid runner who burned through several pairs of Altras, and these are by far the ones I like the most."

This was noticeable when stationary but wasn't much of an issue when on the move. The new top gives a much more secure feel while still breathable. These would be great as running shoes but don't plan on using it as a daily 24/7 shoe. You may not notice that it is restricting your feet at first but after half an hour or longer, you'll want to take them off to let your feet spay out. This feels more like a normal shoe with zero drop rather than the large open toe box of Altra. I have fairly narrow feet also, which makes me think it would be even worse for most people. Sizing up half a size may fix this but may also cause other issues such as heel slippage. The heel in the back does go up higher. This will probably give more secure fit but it also rubs a bit more than the 1.5 did. The midsole is a little more firm, which I actually preferred. It won't have as soft on initial feel but I think it provides better comfort/support beyond the initial 15 mins. The bottom has more foam removed for areas that would bend to give it more flexibility but the rubber sole has basically no threads. It is very slippery on wet and smooth surfaces. My year olf 1.5s had better grip than these 2.0 brand new. Overall, I am disappointed with the revision. On initial try, I thought this would be my new favorite shoe as it felt much more secure than the 1.5 did. The restrictive top material on the toebox was the deal breaker for me. These no longer feel like Altras as my toes felt squished together."

And it looks like a shoe, not an aircraft carrier or an Orca whale.  This shoe runs a bit wider in the mid foot than the Parkclaw and the Trailclaw I tried, which is nice because most standard widths tend to be unnecessarily narrow in my opinion.

I have custom insoles that I would like to use but I can’t because the insoles in this shoe are not removable. There is very little arch support in these, nor is there support (a “bump”) in the middle-front to open the toes a bit. That’s what my custom insoles do. Everyone’s feet are different, so why not allow for customized insoles? Just my two cents. Otherwise these would be great shoes."

Before the Nimbus 17s I had a pair of Cumulus 16s, which I liked a lot, but they weren't cushioned enough, especially in the forefoot. These Cumulus 21s are much better than the Cumulus 16s.

The cushioning is just the right amount for those long easy runs. The upper fits comfortably and the breathability is what can be expected from this type of material. The only down size is the Heel Collar. The way the stitch is made rubbed against my Achilles and created a blister after my first run.

Today, I've worn them for the entire day, on hardwood floors, tiled floors, and for a few short runs around the block on concrete sidewalks. And I have changed my mind about them. Yes, their soles are not quite as stiff (some might say rigid) as those on the Brooks 18 and previous model Beasts. But they are still more firm and supportive than almost any running (not walking) shoe I've ever worn. The sole bottoms are as wide as the 18s, providing a nice stable platform. The rear heel counters are far less stiff and confining than those on the 18, providing good support but sparing me any of the achilles heel and ankle twinges I occasionally experience with the 18s. The breathable pliable engineered mesh over the top middle and toe box areas provides  even more room for the foot and toes than on the 18s, something I'll be able to appreciate late on a hot summer day when my feet sometimes begin to swell a bit. My wife says they look much better than the 18s, which she thought were too thick in the sole and clunky looking. Fact is that the 20's sole is the same thickness as that on the 18s. But Brooks has built and engineered them, together with their large inside guiderails, to look far less beefy and far more sleek and stylish, like a slightly thicker-soled GTS 20. To longtime devotees of the Brooks Beast who are larger and on the heavier side (with over-pronation) than my 6'2"" 180 pound frame, the Beast 18s might still be the definitely preferable shoe. I can only say that, for myself, giving the Beast 20 a good workout and a second chance proved to me just how comfortable and enjoyable they are."

I had been wearing the Bondi 5 but was constantly getting blisters on the insides of both feet.   I tried these on at a pre-race expo and liked how the felt so I gave them a shot.  I had trained in them for about a month before running a half marathon in them.   They were fantastic for the first 8-9 miles, but by mile 10 I had a horrendous hotfoot in the left shoe and really struggled to finish the race.  It could have been the laces being too tight, it could have been a bad sock choice, or maybe they just take a while to properly break in.   They feel much lighter and responsive than the Bondi, and I haven't given up on them yet, but if I can't race in them for more than a 10K I won't be buying another pair."

Until now. 

With this pair, the padded material at the top of the right shoe's Heel Counter caused a blister to form the first day I wore them. I figured it was break-in related and continued wearing them with adhesive blister protectors over my Achilles tendon for another week. It's been almost two months now and I still have to wear a blister protector at the top of my right heel when wearing these shoes. 

My luck with ON shoes has been great in the past so hopefully mine is an isolated problem. I still believe ON makes some of the best running shoes out there and I will continue to support the brand."

I have a wide foot and tried them on before buying and was impressed at how well they fit even being a regular width. They are also extremely comfortable and the laces on them feel like butter. These are the best running shoes I have ever owned.

Cloud X is probably one of the lightest shoes I’ve ever worn (~8oz or so) - this comes with with trade offs:
Pro: light, does not get in the way of running and with other activities; cushion has the same cloud tech that makes it great for running with heel support
Cons: not the best for a heavy rainy day; not the best in an area with a lot uneven surfaces (ie trail running); general protection from injury is weak due to the lightness of the shoe

2. Other details
-only comes with regular shoelaces (no spandex laces like some of the other ON models)
-the back of the shoe is extremely thin, but comfortable
-would not recommend for exercises like weightlifting where you might need more ankle support for heavier lifts
-recommend for runs, sprints(HIIT), and rowing (turns out the limited support on the back of the shoe also does not tug at skin as hard as a well supported back)

Hope this is helpful!"

I have so much foot trouble that I've all but stopped running in anything but the Foundations.  These Cohesions are certainly not going to become my #1, but the fact that I can do shorter runs in them really is a compliment.  The style of the shoe is not great though.  The shiny plastic look of the shoe is more apparent than I assumed from the photos.  I don't much care, but my wife is not a fan of the way they look."

I got the black and love them. The thick sole in these have been cleverly disguised by the two tone sole, so they look more minimalist than they are. Unfortunately while they are extremely light and flexible, they are not as supportive as even my old, worn out Clifton’s so I am considering returning them for the Clifton 6.

Make a long story short I went to my podiatrist and he said because of the horizontal lines and give in the sole I developed a interphalangeal sesamoid issue related to the flexibility of the sneakers. I contacted them to get a cold response and wait 14 days for them busy running folks to stroll onto a response. Then I get the old, read our faqs sorry and you can't return them but you can get a discount for 50% off the next pair. I told them I was wearing a pad on my big toe from the shoes why would I want another one. I didn't even run in them. I was wearing casually. Ruined my tennis game. And I should know better than to fall for some marketing targeting on Instagram. Lesson learned. Just warning y'all. I don't like getting bullied or scammed. BUYER BEWARE."

There is very little arch support in these, nor is there support (a “bump”) in the middle-front to open the toes a bit. That’s what my custom insoles do.

I am trying to get my feet in the habit of a lighter shoe as I'm trying to not make my shoe do all the heavy lifting. For my 3rd active running shoe I was looking for something that had a low drop, nice support/cushioning, and a low weight. This shoes hits all the checks mark. Plus it looks fresh and nice. These are my first pair of Hoka's and I think I'm going to come back to this brand in the future. Here's what I'm using each shoe for:
Hoka One One Rincon's: races/events of all distances. Half-marathon on under.
New Balance Fresh Foam Beacon's: Treadmill training and possible short races like 5K's
Brooks Ghost 11 - Recovery Runs, light jogs, or when my feet hurt."

Then I get the old, read our faqs sorry and you can't return them but you can get a discount for 50% off the next pair. I told them I was wearing a pad on my big toe from the shoes why would I want another one. I didn't even run in them. I was wearing casually. Ruined my tennis game.

The Escalante is just about perfect for me. This is my third pair.
I like the new material in the uppers better than the open mesh of the earlier models -- sand pours in through the older mesh at the beach. If the new upper is a bit heavier for that, I can accept the trade-off.
I also like the low cushion in this model because I like to feel the ground as I run.  I do anticipate that the smoother tread pattern (vs. earlier model) will make it more difficult to see 'tread wear' patterns for analyzing gait symmetry, braking, and landing zones.  But it is less likely to pick up mud and grit that might get tracked into the house.  See photo for both tread pattern and typical grit.  Always trade offs."

I have been a New Balance 990 guy for the last twenty or so years. I was ready to push the button here on v5 when a little more hipper spirit nudged me over to the Brooks' side of Zappos. 

While in Brooksville, I travelled to where the Adrenalines hang out.  They looked cool, light, comfy, and came in widths. I chose the stealth black 13 4E. 

I speed walk with my Labrador Retriever 6 miles a day and I'm happy to say I may be faster, certainly more comfortable, and obviously overjoyed in my selection. And yes, I'm coming back for more Adrenaline (Black / Lime and Black / Ketchup) ; one pair for my birthday, and one pair for Christmas.

I've been shopping at Zappos for about 10 years and, ladies and gentlemen, you have not let me down once. I actually look forward to returning shoes (wrong sizes) so I can hang with the customer service folks.

Thanks much for making this guy's shoe buying journey more enjoyable."

It is nice to have a tall, comfortable stack with a zero drop. There are three things that I found to be problems. First, the shoes are longer than others of the same size, by at least a half to a full size, but true to width, so a smaller size may not be an option if your shoes already fit snugly. Second, there is no extra lace hole at the top as found on most running shoes, to permit back-lacing; the result is excess heel slipping. Third, the raised print on the hard details of the inside of the sole saws at your ankle on the occasional graze, to the point of drawing blood; I shaved these off with a scalpel. From a comfort and performance perspective these are among the best Altra has offered. From a design perspective they need a little work."

I have a real problem with overpronation and need sneakers that help correct the problem and provide stability. This pair is excellent and is possibly the best I have worn to help my aching feet. I wear a 9.5 EE in a Brooks Beast but my previous Hoka's were a 10 because a 9.5 was just too small so I opted up a half size. This pair isn't quite a perfect fit but a 9.5 would have been tight. As long as I wear socks, the Gaviota 2 works,  Width is good and walking around on these is a feel-good experience. Or perhaps I should write a feet-good experience. The sole of this sneaker flairs out just enough to provide the stability I need. Plus the Gaviota 2 is practically weightless. I am truly pleased with this purchase."

For my 3rd active running shoe I was looking for something that had a low drop, nice support/cushioning, and a low weight. This shoes hits all the checks mark. Plus it looks fresh and nice. These are my first pair of Hoka's and I think I'm going to come back to this brand in the future. Here's what I'm using each shoe for:
Hoka One One Rincon's: races/events of all distances. Half-marathon on under.
New Balance Fresh Foam Beacon's: Treadmill training and possible short races like 5K's

My purpose in buying this shoe was for recumbent cycling (3 wheel). Since my toes are somewhat hammered resulting in uncomfortable pressure when biking or walking. I also have a wide foot so I ordered size 11.5 - 4X width. These shoes were the solution to a nagging problem and have proven after multiple uses that I made the right decision. They are light yet hold my feet firmly in place when I ride. I am extremely happy with these shoes.

As other reviews have noted these shoes have a generous toe box, which is good for me but worth noting if you have a narrower foot."

There is very little arch support in these, nor is there support (a “bump”) in the middle-front to open the toes a bit. That’s what my custom insoles do. Everyone’s feet are different, so why not allow for customized insoles? Just my two cents. Otherwise these would be great shoes."

Last year I changed to ghost 11 womens 10.5 which was super comfortable but mid year the fit was changed to more narrow. This seems to be the trend with Brooks.

The cushioning is just the right amount for those long easy runs. The upper fits comfortably and the breathability is what can be expected from this type of material. The only down size is the Heel Collar. The way the stitch is made rubbed against my Achilles and created a blister after my first run. Granted I run in low show socks so from now on I will wear a longer sock with this show.

This v3 is by far the WORST so far and a definite step backwards by NB - if Zappos has an old dusty box of v2 13EE's lying around, I'd gladly trade for them. As others have said, while the width when you look at the shoe inserts is about the same, and the length actually appears to be slightly longer, the fit is definitely tighter, meaning the vertical size of the interior must be smaller. Whoever the marketing genius is that decided to ""improve"" this model version should be fired, or at least forced to wear these damn shoes. The stability still seems as good as before but every other aspect of this shoe is worse than before. The tongue is too short, the heal height is too short, and even the freaking the laces are too short. I've been wearing this pair, hoping they would break in better, so can't really return them, but I now need to search beyond New Balance for good shoes."

I wear women’s size 10.5 or 11 but have needed to move to men’s sizing for more room in the toe box. This version of adrenaline is not good, the toe box is narrow and there is no cushion. Last year I changed to ghost 11 womens 10.5 which was super comfortable but mid year the fit was changed to more narrow. This seems to be the trend with Brooks. The wide sizes, which are limited, are just too big in the heel and instep. I don’t understand who the running  shoe companies are targeting with all the narrow shoes on the market.

They're perfect for travel. The biggest improvement is that they do not squeak like my old model ones did in the rain. Previously, just walking on a damp sidewalk would have the shoes squeaking for blocks afterwards. Although not completely silent, they're much quieter and I'm glad I made the purchase. These are also much lighter and the new ""no lacing"" bungees are great, with a nice clean look.
2 things I'm not crazy about: 
1) half of the logo came off the front of the shoe today on the very first wearing! Really, I don't think this has ever happened in my entire life... would think the brand is important enough to stay on the shoe.
2) the sole, especially at the tip of the shoe, is a little slippery in the rain, even on asphalt. As I'm walking, not running, I can feel the slippage as I step."

It gives room for my toes to naturally splay and feel comfortable without being pinched with a traditional tool box design. The heal I found to be too abrasive and snug. The lack of cushion and the stitching was uncomfortable. I wore my usual socks which are the Injinji brand and it was just too uncomfortable to wear. If there was more cushioning around the heel I would have enjoyed wearing the shoes more.

I'm 215 lbs and used the shoe for running at a crossfit class and it performed great!  The cushioning and recoil is perfect for a heavier guy like me.  However, at one point we had to balance on one foot and that's when you realize the shoe's soles give quite a bit on the sides of the foot and makes it very ""wobbly"".  It looks great too.  Love it for just day to day use.  It does run true to size so if you have wide feet like me you may want to look into a half size bigger."

Like all Altras, these are zero drop; if you are not used to it, take your time to transition - your Achilles will thank you. Also, they have minimal cushioning, so proper running form is absolutely required. With that out of the way...

These shoes are awesome. Light, fast, comfortable. I'm completely in love with them. I'm an avid runner who burned through several pairs of Altras, and these are by far the ones I like the most."

Cushioning was great, sung running shoe fit and a thin tongue which helps as not to bruise the top of your foot.

I feel like the sizing is accurate for me, a 14 feels like every other 14. The width is fine for my slightly narrow feet. I’ve been on a couple shorter runs and one long run thus far. I don’t notice the rocker at all. I have noticed extra strain in my ankles and calves during and after runs, but my feet, knees, and back love these shoes.

Mizuno's  Wave Creation 20s are the finest running shoes overall, that I have owned so far-  for aesthetics, for encouraging best habits in running and striking mid-foot and rather than stabilize my feet (that I find actually hurts as I am likely mild underpronator, or neutral,  but I have found that ""control"" runners wind up hurting my ankles and tiring me more than those that let me run with my natural flow but encourage it which Mizunos all seem to do in my humble opinion.
 Have found from my first try of Mizunos about 5 years ago  that they seem to  encourage me to run more  properly by making me land towards  mid-foot (as its not so soft as a heel striking shoe that negates any feeling pf  impact to firm asphalt road  ( so will feel more impact if you land on your heel so you tend to try to run by landing more properly on your mid foot and so your naturally in position to  raise into  your next stride.... its not a rebound or an energetic bounce one might find in an air cushioned support runner like the pair of  Nike VaporMax I found to be my favorite comfort runners last summer... but the Mizuno Wave Creations frame has their patented ""infinite wave"" ( a (figure 8  thats really a 2 layers of impact to protect your feet and to give it natural flow) that really helps your foot glide up into the next stride (with a hint of assistance from the shoes flexing up from the prior impact as it moves through the frame of the shoes rear to the front of your foot) so it just seems to support your foot in the best most natural way forward.
     I cannot explain the physics of the Mizuno as its not a bouncy shoe its an impact absorbtion that flexes into the frame of the show and returns some help into the next stride so they do have an energetic feel not the dead feel of some squishy soft sneakers that feel great on landing on heel but then it feels hard to lift into the next stride as they deaden the weight rather than rebound you forward into the next stride...so having said the best about them I can now say that ---they are not my favorite sneakers to run in when my back hurts!!.  In  that case I probably should just use the elliptical--- but sometimes I will take out my bouncier sneakers like the VaporFly AIrMax Nikes (they tend to get flat tires after a few months shhh)  so I am not a big proponent of  other shoes other  than to say they do reduce impact most  of any shoes (along with the Hoka One Cavus I just bought  for bad back days)  and maybe the Beast works  for some folks, but they seemed to  slow me down when I tried them a few weeks ago.  The Wave Creatiion 20s are shoes I would choose to wear when I was feeling rested and not having back pain are these Wave Creation 20s encourage my best performance: I feel like a real runner in my Mizuno Wave Creation 20s- on good days!  
  These creatiion 20s  keep my  feet landing smoothly without any jolt and with mild spring taking off into the next stride forward with minimal bounce, or recoil to point of squishiness that some of the most cushy runners (like maybe the Beast) and others with loads of padding, might encourage bigger guys like me to run back on our heels (and wind up making my back hurt more from that habit in general).  For me the cradling effect that surrounds my foot by fusing the tongue like a webbed foot to the shoe (but its not tight or uncomfortable, in fact its the opposite, it makes you feel your foot is securely protected and makes you think less about obsessing over adjusting the top laces, or using the very top lace holes to thread or the ""normal' top hole of sneakers to thread the laces through and tie them (double or single knot? Double normally for me but with these I felt I could run without my laces tied and I might not care as my foot was well in place with the laces being merely an extra nice touch that they are tied-but maybe not necessary other than to feel slightly more tight (as my feet are big, wide and arches fairly high so top of my big feet make me a heavy Clydesdale, runner at 235-240...so for cushioning and support for bigger runners Mizuno has a higher end sneaker to Creation Wave Inspires at $229. and usually a lmited number available on Zappos or even Amazon, I only have owned 2 pairs of those and they are like more expensive verions of the Wave Creations as they are similar in design only more strongly framed and perhaps they can handle an even larger weight though they also do not cushion so much as support a larger runner to run with better form...so you might look into those if your over 235-240 as the Creations are near their limit I think at around my weight, though someone may review and prove me wrong here...
    .I am never going to be fast, or competitive runner, but I do  appreciate a supportive shoe that respects runners of all levels, and Mizuno may not sell a model that is the comfort equivalent of  the Brooks  Beast,( or a NB 990]994s?)  that seem to attract all the  bigger heavier runners ...but it does have the Wave Creation for us pretty. big guys and for the really big guys I would recommend their Wave Prophecies- as those are both very solid running shoes for Clydesdale runners and bigger and heavier runners needing serious shoes.  Hope this helps somebody as I find very few big guy reviews and this is one of them in a shoe that is good for medium size guys to big heavier guys but not going to be a comfort shoe, its a shoe that is comfortable enough to use if you run with reasonable form and know what its design gives you. You likely will want another pair for days when your back hurts and the Hoka One Cavus or Beasts or Nike AirMax might offer that type of heel strike impact aborbant comfort that these do not provide but will help you avoid needing the comfort runners if you use them before you let yourself hurt your back by running in bad shoes with bad form. Cheers!"

I don’t think I would necessarily use them for heavy-duty fitness activity as they aren’t really the most supportive shoes.  These are great casual shoes or walking shoes.  Feel more comfy than a slipper.

Two thoughts on sizing:
- I wear a size 9, which felt too small.  I bought a half-size up, which was perfect.  Also:
- I have a narrow foot (size 9, 3.7” width) and these were comfortable fit, but might be too narrow for a standard foot size (maybe order a full size up?) and definitely too narrow for a wide foot.  

Anyways, love these shoes and have purchased 3 pairs, so I can’t say enough good things about them.  Wish they had wide sizes so I could get a pair for my partner!!

Side note:  these are made with a knit material, so they aren’t very supportive, so if you need a lot of foot or ankle support, I would not try these shoes."

They're perfect for travel. The biggest improvement is that they do not squeak like my old model ones did in the rain. Previously, just walking on a damp sidewalk would have the shoes squeaking for blocks afterwards. Although not completely silent, they're much quieter and I'm glad I made the purchase. These are also much lighter and the new ""no lacing"" bungees are great, with a nice clean look.
2 things I'm not crazy about: 
1) half of the logo came off the front of the shoe today on the very first wearing! Really, I don't think this has ever happened in my entire life... would think the brand is important enough to stay on the shoe.
2) the sole, especially at the tip of the shoe, is a little slippery in the rain, even on asphalt. As I'm walking, not running, I can feel the slippage as I step."

This v3 is by far the WORST so far and a definite step backwards by NB - if Zappos has an old dusty box of v2 13EE's lying around, I'd gladly trade for them. As others have said, while the width when you look at the shoe inserts is about the same, and the length actually appears to be slightly longer, the fit is definitely tighter, meaning the vertical size of the interior must be smaller. Whoever the marketing genius is that decided to ""improve"" this model version should be fired, or at least forced to wear these damn shoes. The stability still seems as good as before but every other aspect of this shoe is worse than before. The tongue is too short, the heal height is too short, and even the freaking the laces are too short.

I spent a week walking around and running in these shoes. My feet were hurting as it felt like pressure was being put on the ball of the foot or base of the toes due to that feeling of minimal support in the mid-foot. I liked the look but returned the shoes and went with Brooks Adrenaline which has cushy support for the entire foot.

These shoes make a minor swishing noise; 2. They fit tighter than standard On shoes.  

Noise: it’s minor and I am willing to accept it for a waterproof version of my favorite shoe.

Fit: I have the both the On and On 2.0 for comparison and this Waterproof model is tighter and the build is stiffer by comparison.  I solved it by switching to a thin merino wool sock and it’s perfect.  ALSO - they did break in a bit after wearing and the stiffness loosened up.

With Zappos’ awesome return policy, I ordered up a half size to try them.  I thought those would be too loose once broken in.  So ultimately I went with my standard size for On brand and the thinner sock.  

I love On shoes and after logging a few miles in these, I’m happy.  Hope this helps."

I have always had better luck with ASICS than with any other brand.  As a heavier runner, I find the levels of support and cushioning in the Kayano perfectly suited to my frame.  My only complaint is a petty one.  I wear a 4E width, and I am profoundly grateful to ASICS for manufacturing this top-tier shoe in my width.  I understand that the 4E market is very small, so it is unrealistic to ask for all color schemes to be available in 4E widths.   But I just wish that once in a while they would make the 4E width available in one of the more exciting color schemes.  Typically, the 4E width is only available in the blandest color scheme produced.  As I said, it is a petty complaint, and I can live with the bland colors as long as the shoes permit me to continue running injury-free."

First I should say that I am a devoted Altra user but I wanted to add some other brands to my roster.  I like the vongo because of its low drop (4mm).  So for me it was close to what Altra offers and I liked that.  But, here's the difference, New Balance has been around for a long long time and they have tried and true approaches and designs.   These shoes are amazing.  They were a little stiff the first time I wore them but after my first run they were completely broken in.  They have the perfect balance of firmness and softness in the soul.  They feel heavenly on my foot.  The fit is just right, not too tight and not too roomy.  I love them running in them, in fact, I cannot wait to get up in the morning so I can put them on.   I will continue to buy them every year."

In this way lacing through the tongue nib that allowed laces to keep running sneakers tongues from sliding too far left or right is merely a placebo other than maybe assuring the top of your foot covering does not slide down below the top row of laces but my foot fit so snugly that it was not a concern and other than my confusion in putting the shoe on my EE width size 12 sneakers in these somewhat risky 12 D sneakers that I have owned in 12D twice before and were just wide enough to not pinch my boat-feet (as I call them).  Mizuno's  Wave Creation 20s are the finest running shoes overall, that I have owned so far-  for aesthetics, for encouraging best habits in running and striking mid-foot and rather than stabilize my feet (that I find actually hurts as I am likely mild underpronator, or neutral,  but I have found that ""control"" runners wind up hurting my ankles and tiring me more than those that let me run with my natural flow but encourage it which Mizunos all seem to do in my humble opinion.
 Have found from my first try of Mizunos about 5 years ago  that they seem to  encourage me to run more  properly by making me land towards  mid-foot (as its not so soft as a heel striking shoe that negates any feeling pf  impact to firm asphalt road  ( so will feel more impact if you land on your heel so you tend to try to run by landing more properly on your mid foot and so your naturally in position to  raise into  your next stride.... its not a rebound or an energetic bounce one might find in an air cushioned support runner like the pair of  Nike VaporMax I found to be my favorite comfort runners last summer... but the Mizuno Wave Creations frame has their patented ""infinite wave"" ( a (figure 8  thats really a 2 layers of impact to protect your feet and to give it natural flow) that really helps your foot glide up into the next stride (with a hint of assistance from the shoes flexing up from the prior impact as it moves through the frame of the shoes rear to the front of your foot) so it just seems to support your foot in the best most natural way forward.
     I cannot explain the physics of the Mizuno as its not a bouncy shoe its an impact absorbtion that flexes into the frame of the show and returns some help into the next stride so they do have an energetic feel not the dead feel of some squishy soft sneakers that feel great on landing on heel but then it feels hard to lift into the next stride as they deaden the weight rather than rebound you forward into the next stride...so having said the best about them I can now say that ---they are not my favorite sneakers to run in when my back hurts!!.  In  that case I probably should just use the elliptical--- but sometimes I will take out my bouncier sneakers like the VaporFly AIrMax Nikes (they tend to get flat tires after a few months shhh)  so I am not a big proponent of  other shoes other  than to say they do reduce impact most  of any shoes (along with the Hoka One Cavus I just bought  for bad back days)  and maybe the Beast works  for some folks, but they seemed to  slow me down when I tried them a few weeks ago.  The Wave Creatiion 20s are shoes I would choose to wear when I was feeling rested and not having back pain are these Wave Creation 20s encourage my best performance: I feel like a real runner in my Mizuno Wave Creation 20s- on good days!  
  These creatiion 20s  keep my  feet landing smoothly without any jolt and with mild spring taking off into the next stride forward with minimal bounce, or recoil to point of squishiness that some of the most cushy runners (like maybe the Beast) and others with loads of padding, might encourage bigger guys like me to run back on our heels (and wind up making my back hurt more from that habit in general).  For me the cradling effect that surrounds my foot by fusing the tongue like a webbed foot to the shoe (but its not tight or uncomfortable, in fact its the opposite, it makes you feel your foot is securely protected and makes you think less about obsessing over adjusting the top laces, or using the very top lace holes to thread or the ""normal' top hole of sneakers to thread the laces through and tie them (double or single knot? Double normally for me but with these I felt I could run without my laces tied and I might not care as my foot was well in place with the laces being merely an extra nice touch that they are tied-but maybe not necessary other than to feel slightly more tight (as my feet are big, wide and arches fairly high so top of my big feet make me a heavy Clydesdale, runner at 235-240...so for cushioning and support for bigger runners Mizuno has a higher end sneaker to Creation Wave Inspires at $229. and usually a lmited number available on Zappos or even Amazon, I only have owned 2 pairs of those and they are like more expensive verions of the Wave Creations as they are similar in design only more strongly framed and perhaps they can handle an even larger weight though they also do not cushion so much as support a larger runner to run with better form...so you might look into those if your over 235-240 as the Creations are near their limit I think at around my weight, though someone may review and prove me wrong here...
    .I am never going to be fast, or competitive runner, but I do  appreciate a supportive shoe that respects runners of all levels, and Mizuno may not sell a model that is the comfort equivalent of  the Brooks  Beast,( or a NB 990]994s?)  that seem to attract all the  bigger heavier runners ...but it does have the Wave Creation for us pretty. big guys and for the really big guys I would recommend their Wave Prophecies- as those are both very solid running shoes for Clydesdale runners and bigger and heavier runners needing serious shoes.  Hope this helps somebody as I find very few big guy reviews and this is one of them in a shoe that is good for medium size guys to big heavier guys but not going to be a comfort shoe, its a shoe that is comfortable enough to use if you run with reasonable form and know what its design gives you. You likely will want another pair for days when your back hurts and the Hoka One Cavus or Beasts or Nike AirMax might offer that type of heel strike impact aborbant comfort that these do not provide but will help you avoid needing the comfort runners if you use them before you let yourself hurt your back by running in bad shoes with bad form. Cheers!"

That might be from the webbed design that this new model has over the older Clifton models. The toe box was also not right for me (too constricting) as well as strangely shaped inwards but for some reason, the length was ok. Odd. Zappos did not have a 12 1/2 so I bought that somewhere else. After three days of those Hoka Clifton 6's, I had to return them also since they literally destroyed my feet. My Plantar Fasciitis which I have not felt in 10 years of wearing Asics came back with a vengeance, as well as the slight Metatarsalgia that I have also forgotten about. This is due to the fore foot not having enough room to splay your toes correctly and not having any support for the Metatarsal region. I suppose the rocker mid sole that these shoe are known for are doing this. Bad design for me. I learned my lesson. I could only imagine if I put up with the discomfort any longer in order to ""break these in"". 

Also, these sneakers are advertised as ""neutral"" which is why I bought them in the first place but I found that the inner soles were slightly high as opposed to the outer parts of the soles that I was standing slightly uncomfortably bowed. I would NOT recommend these for anyone that has arch problems, Metatarsalgia, arthritis or Morton's Neuroma problems of any sort because these sneakers will only make those conditions much worse. They have absolutely no extra room to put your own orthotics in and only make the overall constricting feeling worse on your toes and arches.

I fell for the advertising. This new model is supposed to be the roomiest most comfortable of the whole Hoka One One line and I've seen some Foot Doctors actually recommending these because of the cushioning. The overall cushioning IS good I do admit, if that is what you are looking for, but Hoka is off my list for good."

I love how these shoes fit my feet like a glove. I normally wear a 9.5, that's the size I ordered, and that's the size I would stick with.

I chose the primer/ebony/black color combo and love how they look in person. I also love the woven material used in the shoe -- really cool texture and very breathable.

I used to wear Nike shoes almost exclusively (they do make great shoes), but I am now very much a Brooks fan. I highly recommend the Revel 3 (even if you're a walker and not a runner)."

Super lightweight and comfortable.  Only had them a short while so can't comment on durability.  The only issue I had was that I had to exchange sizes initially. I usually wear a 10.5 in New Balance and it seemed most people felt like these ran the same as New Balance so I got the 10.5. I ended up exchanging them for a 10 which fit perfectly.

The store gave me a deal because I was their only customer who could wear them. They were the only shoes I ever had that truly fit until the magic of online shopping allowed me to find such shoes again. Even so, they are few and far between. In fact, these are the first running shoes I’ve seen. I usually settle for B’s. I walk 5-7 miles a day on NYC sidewalks, so I need a good shoe. These fit the bill for that so far. I’ve only worn them for about 3 weeks. I’ll see how long they last, but my previous, cheaper pairs of New Balance have done well. I usually can get my 10.5 foot into an 11 NB B-width. These required a full size bigger. My foot fits like a glove. At first, I thought they were too narrow and then I removed the extra pair of socks that I always wear in all my other shoes. Perfect!  Gave style 4 stars only because I really wanted a pair of whites and I had a choice between black and black. I admit that I get tired of the NB logo, too. But I’m grateful to the company for filling a very small market niche. There are not a lot of men’s AA feet out there.  P.S. It’s a little thing. I’ve been double-tying running shoes for years because the furshligginer laces keep untying. These are hard to UNTIE when I double-tie them, but when I single-tie them, they usually stay tied. May their tribe increase."

Nike keeps changing the model number.  The Revolution 4 shoe was perfect to size, comfort, weight, and style. Apparently the Rev-4 is being phased out based on the remaining 3 pathetic colors that remain in Zappo inventory. This leads to the Rev-5.  It is different enough to irritate me.  The fit is tighter and not as comfortable as Rev-4, the angle of the foot is different and not as comfortable, and the sole looks more like a platform.  I will keep these, but I wish they would stop the racket of obsolescence just so they can offer a new shoe at a higher price."

I wore them running for a couple of days and was so impressed with them, that I bought a second pair; different color (white). the fact that I ordered two pairs of the same shoe(s) in one week pretty much sums up my feelings for these shoes. Typically, I wear Hoka One One shoes. For some reason,( probably the pretty yellow color available), I decided to give these New Balance a try. They don't have the same support as Hokas, but they are still a great shoes  for middle distance running; Hoka shoes (my opinion) are better for long distance running. If you are a 5 or 10k runner, these new Balance 1500v6 are great shoes. If you are running anything over a 10K, I would recommend Hoka One One shoes. By the way, the yellow color and the white color for these particular shoes (NB 1500v6) are super beautiful colors. I wish more shoes were available in yellow"

This pair has a hole now (inner lining near the heel, exposing plastic), 4 months after purchase. They were not worn every day, maybe every other day for an hour or two. They should not wear out this quickly, but in my experience, all Hokas do wear out this quickly. The sole material also compresses pretty fast, making them much less cushy in just a few months. Overall, I still like these shoes because they are really comfortable, but I'm finding the value lacking. For $100-$150+, a shoe should last *at least* 6-8 months."

He is a bodybuilder type so used to wearing very flat trainer shoes but he’d had it with those shoes after the first 3 days of class. So I snuck these into our house and it took very little convincing for him to try them, which tells me he was in a world of hurt haha. Needless to say, his feet have been much happier the past two days. He said “well they don’t look as cool as my D-Maks but my feet don’t hurt.” There’s no way he would be caught dead in the bulkier Hokas but these are somewhat lower profile and subdued so they apparently pass LOL.

Buying shoes that will allow me to comfortably go on my daily 8 - 10 mile walks has been challenging, to say the least. Holier-than-thou shoe experts swear that it is impossible to have both underpronation AND flat feet.  Thus, I was doomed to wear shoes that would help one issue but not the other. 

Until, by pure happenstance, I read an online article about the best running shoes for underpronation.  An honorable mention was given to the Saucony Echelon 7, with a notation that these were also great shoes for those with flat feet.  Eureka! Off to zappos.com I go.

So here I am. The Echelon 7s get very little love from Zappos customers but I think they're great.  I can go on extended walks and not feel like my spine is going to pierce through my neck.  It has been a very long time since I've had shoes that support my feet this well.  The styling is perfectly innocuous; there is nothing flashy about the Echelon 7s, which is something I greatly appreciate.

Criticisms? The overall cushioning could be better, but this is a very minor issue.  Overall, I am very pleased with these shoes."

I have always had better luck with ASICS than with any other brand.  As a heavier runner, I find the levels of support and cushioning in the Kayano perfectly suited to my frame.  My only complaint is a petty one.  I wear a 4E width, and I am profoundly grateful to ASICS for manufacturing this top-tier shoe in my width.  I understand that the 4E market is very small, so it is unrealistic to ask for all color schemes to be available in 4E widths.   But I just wish that once in a while they would make the 4E width available in one of the more exciting color schemes.  Typically, the 4E width is only available in the blandest color scheme produced.  As I said, it is a petty complaint, and I can live with the bland colors as long as the shoes permit me to continue running injury-free."

That might be from the webbed design that this new model has over the older Clifton models. The toe box was also not right for me (too constricting) as well as strangely shaped inwards but for some reason, the length was ok. Odd. Zappos did not have a 12 1/2 so I bought that somewhere else. After three days of those Hoka Clifton 6's, I had to return them also since they literally destroyed my feet. My Plantar Fasciitis which I have not felt in 10 years of wearing Asics came back with a vengeance, as well as the slight Metatarsalgia that I have also forgotten about. This is due to the fore foot not having enough room to splay your toes correctly and not having any support for the Metatarsal region. I suppose the rocker mid sole that these shoe are known for are doing this. Bad design for me. I learned my lesson. I could only imagine if I put up with the discomfort any longer in order to ""break these in"". 

Also, these sneakers are advertised as ""neutral"" which is why I bought them in the first place but I found that the inner soles were slightly high as opposed to the outer parts of the soles that I was standing slightly uncomfortably bowed. I would NOT recommend these for anyone that has arch problems, Metatarsalgia, arthritis or Morton's Neuroma problems of any sort because these sneakers will only make those conditions much worse. They have absolutely no extra room to put your own orthotics in and only make the overall constricting feeling worse on your toes and arches.

I fell for the advertising. This new model is supposed to be the roomiest most comfortable of the whole Hoka One One line and I've seen some Foot Doctors actually recommending these because of the cushioning. The overall cushioning IS good I do admit, if that is what you are looking for, but Hoka is off my list for good."

Some pros: breath really well, good for a foot that isn’t medium, but also not quite true wide (although that isn’t me) Cons: run about a half size large, insert keep sliding around while walking and especially running. 

Overall, good shoe, but slightly overpriced for the quality."

These fit me like the proverbial glove in a 10.5, and I'm about to order a second pair.  I have kind of painful feet, and Saucony is the brand that seems to fit me the best, while also having the specs I need in a walking shoe, which is what I use running shoes for.  The low heel-to-toe drop of the old Triumph 11, the Zealot ISO and now this Ride ISO2 is exactly what I need.  But unlike those models, these are incredibly cushy.  The midsole cushioning is a revelation, as is the lack of weight and large footprint of the Triumph ISO3s I also have.  The energy return is better than any shoe in any brand I've ever worn.  I could just walk and walk, and my feet don't kill me.  And they're a such good-looking shoes in the black color.  As much as I admire the flash and neon colors of other running shoes, I'm not a flashy person. 
 What a fantastic shoe - I love them.  Grab them while you can because as sure as the sun comes up, Saucony will change them next season."

Tried regular On Cloud in a store, and size 10 felt just a tad too tight, and 10.5 we maybe a tad too loose.
Ordered the On Cloud Waterproof in 10.5, and they were just right -- my guess is, due to an extra membrane layer, they are just a bit tighter than their non-waterproof counterpart.

Fit and finish are nothing short of stellar. 
Shoes are laced with an elastic string (not my cup of tea), but regular laces are included in the box.
I'd say the laces are on the shorter side, and definitely too short to lock the heel in (that is, to use all holes at the top of the shoe).

The shoes are very comfortable, but definitely a tad warm, which is to be expected as they are waterproof."

I found the wider version of this shoe but what you get is a shoe that is about 1/4 inch longer but there's no real change in width and the section of the shoe that holds the laces will dig into the top of your foot because they are too long.  They also have great arch support but if you have high arches and your ankles turn outward (underpronate or supinate) they might make the problem worse.   The sole of this shoe is so comfortable and infact, my sister who has narrow feet and plantar fasciitis tried them on and ended up ordering her own pair and she loves them.  She no longer has pain in her feet and she has found she can stand for 8 hours at work and not have any issues any longer.   My two stars are for the width otherwise it's a great shoe."

The upper is SUPER breathable, you can see your socks through the mesh which is kind of fun."

I am trying to get my feet in the habit of a lighter shoe as I'm trying to not make my shoe do all the heavy lifting. For my 3rd active running shoe I was looking for something that had a low drop, nice support/cushioning, and a low weight. This shoes hits all the checks mark. Plus it looks fresh and nice. These are my first pair of Hoka's and I think I'm going to come back to this brand in the future. Here's what I'm using each shoe for:
Hoka One One Rincon's: races/events of all distances. Half-marathon on under.
New Balance Fresh Foam Beacon's: Treadmill training and possible short races like 5K's
Brooks Ghost 11 - Recovery Runs, light jogs, or when my feet hurt."

I have custom insoles that I would like to use but I can’t because the insoles in this shoe are not removable. There is very little arch support in these, nor is there support (a “bump”) in the middle-front to open the toes a bit. That’s what my custom insoles do. Everyone’s feet are different, so why not allow for customized insoles? Just my two cents. Otherwise these would be great shoes."

I wear women’s size 10.5 or 11 but have needed to move to men’s sizing for more room in the toe box. This version of adrenaline is not good, the toe box is narrow and there is no cushion. Last year I changed to ghost 11 womens 10.5 which was super comfortable but mid year the fit was changed to more narrow. This seems to be the trend with Brooks. The wide sizes, which are limited, are just too big in the heel and instep. I don’t understand who the running  shoe companies are targeting with all the narrow shoes on the market.

The 10 feels a little wider than the 9 which is a good thing. The shoe also feels lighter.

Now onto the bad, the shoe seems lighter because it feels like they cheaper on the material. Gone is the good side support which has been replaced thin lightweight fabric. Add to the fact they opted for grey and brown which doesn't go together all that well it seems like Brooks has stuck to the design idea of one step forward two steps back."

These fit me like the proverbial glove in a 10.5, and I'm about to order a second pair.  I have kind of painful feet, and Saucony is the brand that seems to fit me the best, while also having the specs I need in a walking shoe, which is what I use running shoes for.  The low heel-to-toe drop of the old Triumph 11, the Zealot ISO and now this Ride ISO2 is exactly what I need.  But unlike those models, these are incredibly cushy.  The midsole cushioning is a revelation, as is the lack of weight and large footprint of the Triumph ISO3s I also have.  The energy return is better than any shoe in any brand I've ever worn.  I could just walk and walk, and my feet don't kill me.  And they're a such good-looking shoes in the black color.  As much as I admire the flash and neon colors of other running shoes, I'm not a flashy person. 
 What a fantastic shoe - I love them.  Grab them while you can because as sure as the sun comes up, Saucony will change them next season."

I don’t think I would necessarily use them for heavy-duty fitness activity as they aren’t really the most supportive shoes.  These are great casual shoes or walking shoes.  Feel more comfy than a slipper.

Two thoughts on sizing:
- I wear a size 9, which felt too small.  I bought a half-size up, which was perfect.  Also:
- I have a narrow foot (size 9, 3.7” width) and these were comfortable fit, but might be too narrow for a standard foot size (maybe order a full size up?) and definitely too narrow for a wide foot.  

Anyways, love these shoes and have purchased 3 pairs, so I can’t say enough good things about them.  Wish they had wide sizes so I could get a pair for my partner!!

Side note:  these are made with a knit material, so they aren’t very supportive, so if you need a lot of foot or ankle support, I would not try these shoes."

The Zoom Fly and Epic Reacts have gotten me from zero through a marathon. I wanted something I could put miles in, that wouldn’t beat up my body. Did the research and decided on the Clifton 6’s. I feel like the sizing is accurate for me, a 14 feels like every other 14. The width is fine for my slightly narrow feet. I’ve been on a couple shorter runs and one long run thus far. I don’t notice the rocker at all. I have noticed extra strain in my ankles and calves during and after runs, but my feet, knees, and back love these shoes. I ran two hours one day (long for me at this point) and was able to hit a personal best back squat the next day. I’m going to keep them as my distance shoe and see how they do with multiple long runs in them."

Super comfortable, nice cushion, perfect sizing. However, inside the shoe near the arch, there’s a piece of fabric that is stitched along one edge, but not the rest. Rather, it’s coated in adhesive to keep it in place. That adhesive is useless, and the fabric rolls up into an irritating bundle, rubbing against your foot all day. This defect occurred day 1. I would try to rip the fabric out, but the stitched edge prevents that possibility, so I might resort to an xacto knife to cut it out."

I have been a New Balance 990 guy for the last twenty or so years. I was ready to push the button here on v5 when a little more hipper spirit nudged me over to the Brooks' side of Zappos. 

While in Brooksville, I travelled to where the Adrenalines hang out.  They looked cool, light, comfy, and came in widths. I chose the stealth black 13 4E. 

I speed walk with my Labrador Retriever 6 miles a day and I'm happy to say I may be faster, certainly more comfortable, and obviously overjoyed in my selection. And yes, I'm coming back for more Adrenaline (Black / Lime and Black / Ketchup) ; one pair for my birthday, and one pair for Christmas.

I've been shopping at Zappos for about 10 years and, ladies and gentlemen, you have not let me down once. I actually look forward to returning shoes (wrong sizes) so I can hang with the customer service folks.

Thanks much for making this guy's shoe buying journey more enjoyable."

These shoes make a minor swishing noise; 2. They fit tighter than standard On shoes.  

Noise: it’s minor and I am willing to accept it for a waterproof version of my favorite shoe.

Fit: I have the both the On and On 2.0 for comparison and this Waterproof model is tighter and the build is stiffer by comparison.  I solved it by switching to a thin merino wool sock and it’s perfect.  ALSO - they did break in a bit after wearing and the stiffness loosened up.

With Zappos’ awesome return policy, I ordered up a half size to try them.  I thought those would be too loose once broken in.  So ultimately I went with my standard size for On brand and the thinner sock.  

I love On shoes and after logging a few miles in these, I’m happy.  Hope this helps."

They also have great arch support but if you have high arches and your ankles turn outward (underpronate or supinate) they might make the problem worse.   The sole of this shoe is so comfortable and infact, my sister who has narrow feet and plantar fasciitis tried them on and ended up ordering her own pair and she loves them.  She no longer has pain in her feet and she has found she can stand for 8 hours at work and not have any issues any longer.   My two stars are for the width otherwise it's a great shoe."

While I like the original Levitate it didn’t offer some of the features this new model does that set it
apart from other models.  I typically have a tough time breaking in running shoes, dealing with blistering for the first few wears.  With the Levitate 2, the break-in period was non-existent
and I extended my first few runs in them, which I’ve never been able to do before.  I would consider myself an avid runner, but I plan to increase my running regiment based on the comfort 
of this shoe.  Much like the original, it’s lightweight and seems to work well with my flat feet.  Excited to see what additional color ways they plan to launch."

I wear women’s size 10.5 or 11 but have needed to move to men’s sizing for more room in the toe box. This version of adrenaline is not good, the toe box is narrow and there is no cushion. Last year I changed to ghost 11 womens 10.5 which was super comfortable but mid year the fit was changed to more narrow. This seems to be the trend with Brooks. The wide sizes, which are limited, are just too big in the heel and instep. I don’t understand who the running  shoe companies are targeting with all the narrow shoes on the market.

I have custom insoles that I would like to use but I can’t because the insoles in this shoe are not removable. There is very little arch support in these, nor is there support (a “bump”) in the middle-front to open the toes a bit. That’s what my custom insoles do. Everyone’s feet are different, so why not allow for customized insoles? Just my two cents. Otherwise these would be great shoes."

These are super lightweight and excellent travel shoes. I walk a lot in these shoes on vacations and love how little space they take up.

I have consistency been a ""12"" which they equate to a 47EU (which is nuts) - 12 is a 45EU. Anyways the 2.0 is def more snug and smaller.

It's tighter in the heel - which I like, but also very tight in the mid section. I had to go a half size up to tolerate wearing them for more than a few hours. 

Beyond the ""fit"" they are still my go to travel and casual sneakers. I get a lot of compliments on them."

(I'm a 12-B in New Balance walking shoes, but have been a 12.5-B in the Brooks Addiction.)

That half-size-up approach also worked well for the Addiction 12 and the Addiction 13, but not for the Addiction 14. Its footbed seems longer at the same size as the 11/12/13. My test, aside from noticing that my heel was slipping up more than in the earlier models, was to slide my orthotic around inside the 14. There's definitely more room for the orthotic insert front-to-back in the 14 than in the 13. 

I've exchanged the Addiction 14 for one a half-size smaller, which should be about right. Excellent service on the advance exchange from Zappos, too."

There is very little arch support in these, nor is there support (a “bump”) in the middle-front to open the toes a bit. That’s what my custom insoles do.

I feel like the sizing is accurate for me, a 14 feels like every other 14. The width is fine for my slightly narrow feet. I’ve been on a couple shorter runs and one long run thus far. I don’t notice the rocker at all. I have noticed extra strain in my ankles and calves during and after runs, but my feet, knees, and back love these shoes. I ran two hours one day (long for me at this point) and was able to hit a personal best back squat the next day.

Overall, the shoe looks and feels similar to the 35. However, one subtle change that significantly affected fit was the rubber overlay around the top edge of the toe box. It is between 1/2 and 3/4 of an inch and goes from one side of the ball of your foot over the top of the ends of your toes and back down the other side to the ball of your foot. In speaking with Nike they said it was to provide some additional support. What I found it prevented my toes from expanding and made the toe box feel tighter. I liked previous versions because I have 10 4E feet so the shoes always fit and allowed my toes to expand. Unfortunately because of this small change I had to return the shoes and will be looking for a new everyday running shoe."

It might not be the sleekest runner ever, but it's a classic. I can spend the entire day in my 990's and my feet feel fresh.

Unfortunately, they are not sturdy and broke down almost completely within 3 months of light/moderate use.  They have ripped at the forefoot as others have mentioned, as well as had splits along then cuff (?) of the shoe.  Additionally at this point the support has gone and I can no longer run in them.  Thanks to Zappos wonderful support I returned my first pair due to this, and the now the second has had the same issue 3 months in.  For the price, i'm disappointed they didn't last longer and I cannot rationalize spending this kind of money on a 3 month shoe, even if they are/were crazy comfortable."

After a few weeks I just could not wear them anymore. I’d have sent them back but the box was needed for a school project. Some pros: breath really well, good for a foot that isn’t medium, but also not quite true wide (although that isn’t me) Cons: run about a half size large, insert keep sliding around while walking and especially running. 

Overall, good shoe, but slightly overpriced for the quality."

It is a fantastic shoe. I had the 11 GTX version and now also have the Ghost 12 GTX and the regular (non-GTX) 12. Both the Ghost 12 GTX and Ghost 12 versions are really good and more lithe than the 11's as they reduced some of the weight. Somehow they seem to have alleviated my plantar fasciitis and important for me the higher drop allows me to run pain-free in my troublesome calf. They are more padded than the Saucony shoes I formerly wore and may not be perfect for races but for training, for me they are superb. Just finished an 8 mile run. While a really big thing, the style of the black versions are nice and I wear them to restaurants sometimes and they look ok there."

First I should say that I am a devoted Altra user but I wanted to add some other brands to my roster.  I like the vongo because of its low drop (4mm).  So for me it was close to what Altra offers and I liked that.  But, here's the difference, New Balance has been around for a long long time and they have tried and true approaches and designs.   These shoes are amazing.  They were a little stiff the first time I wore them but after my first run they were completely broken in.  They have the perfect balance of firmness and softness in the soul.  They feel heavenly on my foot.  The fit is just right, not too tight and not too roomy.  I love them running in them, in fact, I cannot wait to get up in the morning so I can put them on.   I will continue to buy them every year."

It's tighter in the heel - which I like, but also very tight in the mid section. I had to go a half size up to tolerate wearing them for more than a few hours.

The  Arahi is a nice stability shoe, slightly lighter in weight than the Graviota, slightly less support, or a different feel to the support than the Graviota.  I wear custom fit orthotics, and they fit ok in both shoes.  The Arahi felt slightly longer and slightly wider to my feet than the Graviota even though the description and reviews say the Arahi is a narrower shoe.  The Graviota feels like it has more cushioning than the Arahi.  For my foot, the Graviota gives a nice, snug, supportive fit.  First time purchasing Hoka, so curious how they will last in comparison to my Brooks and New Balance."

The shoes build quality appears excellent, and they are very light. They also offer solid motion control, so they are a sound choice for over-pronators. 

I've read in other reviews that the ""bouncy"" quality of the shoe is more related to the extra plush insoles they shoes ship with than the puffy looking exterior of the shoes. I can confirm this is true as I've replaced the insoles in mine to ones with more arch support. However, the shoes remain very comfortable."

Cloud X is probably one of the lightest shoes I’ve ever worn (~8oz or so) - this comes with with trade offs:
Pro: light, does not get in the way of running and with other activities; cushion has the same cloud tech that makes it great for running with heel support
Cons: not the best for a heavy rainy day; not the best in an area with a lot uneven surfaces (ie trail running); general protection from injury is weak due to the lightness of the shoe

2. Other details
-only comes with regular shoelaces (no spandex laces like some of the other ON models)
-the back of the shoe is extremely thin, but comfortable
-would not recommend for exercises like weightlifting where you might need more ankle support for heavier lifts
-recommend for runs, sprints(HIIT), and rowing (turns out the limited support on the back of the shoe also does not tug at skin as hard as a well supported back)

Hope this is helpful!"

I truly hope they do make a shoe next that has even more squish to the cushion and my only real gripe would be the tongue was like scratchy without socks when I first tried them on. So as a slip on and do something quick kind of messed that up but with socks The shoe is awesome. But please fix the tongue and add more squish to the cushion and I think this would beat 95% of comfort shoes on the market. God bless

It is nice to have a tall, comfortable stack with a zero drop. There are three things that I found to be problems. First, the shoes are longer than others of the same size, by at least a half to a full size, but true to width, so a smaller size may not be an option if your shoes already fit snugly. Second, there is no extra lace hole at the top as found on most running shoes, to permit back-lacing; the result is excess heel slipping. Third, the raised print on the hard details of the inside of the sole saws at your ankle on the occasional graze, to the point of drawing blood; I shaved these off with a scalpel. From a comfort and performance perspective these are among the best Altra has offered. From a design perspective they need a little work."

I have always had better luck with ASICS than with any other brand.  As a heavier runner, I find the levels of support and cushioning in the Kayano perfectly suited to my frame.  My only complaint is a petty one.  I wear a 4E width, and I am profoundly grateful to ASICS for manufacturing this top-tier shoe in my width.  I understand that the 4E market is very small, so it is unrealistic to ask for all color schemes to be available in 4E widths.   But I just wish that once in a while they would make the 4E width available in one of the more exciting color schemes.  Typically, the 4E width is only available in the blandest color scheme produced.  As I said, it is a petty complaint, and I can live with the bland colors as long as the shoes permit me to continue running injury-free."

In this way lacing through the tongue nib that allowed laces to keep running sneakers tongues from sliding too far left or right is merely a placebo other than maybe assuring the top of your foot covering does not slide down below the top row of laces but my foot fit so snugly that it was not a concern and other than my confusion in putting the shoe on my EE width size 12 sneakers in these somewhat risky 12 D sneakers that I have owned in 12D twice before and were just wide enough to not pinch my boat-feet (as I call them).  Mizuno's  Wave Creation 20s are the finest running shoes overall, that I have owned so far-  for aesthetics, for encouraging best habits in running and striking mid-foot and rather than stabilize my feet (that I find actually hurts as I am likely mild underpronator, or neutral,  but I have found that ""control"" runners wind up hurting my ankles and tiring me more than those that let me run with my natural flow but encourage it which Mizunos all seem to do in my humble opinion.
 Have found from my first try of Mizunos about 5 years ago  that they seem to  encourage me to run more  properly by making me land towards  mid-foot (as its not so soft as a heel striking shoe that negates any feeling pf  impact to firm asphalt road  ( so will feel more impact if you land on your heel so you tend to try to run by landing more properly on your mid foot and so your naturally in position to  raise into  your next stride.... its not a rebound or an energetic bounce one might find in an air cushioned support runner like the pair of  Nike VaporMax I found to be my favorite comfort runners last summer... but the Mizuno Wave Creations frame has their patented ""infinite wave"" ( a (figure 8  thats really a 2 layers of impact to protect your feet and to give it natural flow) that really helps your foot glide up into the next stride (with a hint of assistance from the shoes flexing up from the prior impact as it moves through the frame of the shoes rear to the front of your foot) so it just seems to support your foot in the best most natural way forward.
     I cannot explain the physics of the Mizuno as its not a bouncy shoe its an impact absorbtion that flexes into the frame of the show and returns some help into the next stride so they do have an energetic feel not the dead feel of some squishy soft sneakers that feel great on landing on heel but then it feels hard to lift into the next stride as they deaden the weight rather than rebound you forward into the next stride...so having said the best about them I can now say that ---they are not my favorite sneakers to run in when my back hurts!!.  In  that case I probably should just use the elliptical--- but sometimes I will take out my bouncier sneakers like the VaporFly AIrMax Nikes (they tend to get flat tires after a few months shhh)  so I am not a big proponent of  other shoes other  than to say they do reduce impact most  of any shoes (along with the Hoka One Cavus I just bought  for bad back days)  and maybe the Beast works  for some folks, but they seemed to  slow me down when I tried them a few weeks ago.  The Wave Creatiion 20s are shoes I would choose to wear when I was feeling rested and not having back pain are these Wave Creation 20s encourage my best performance: I feel like a real runner in my Mizuno Wave Creation 20s- on good days!  
  These creatiion 20s  keep my  feet landing smoothly without any jolt and with mild spring taking off into the next stride forward with minimal bounce, or recoil to point of squishiness that some of the most cushy runners (like maybe the Beast) and others with loads of padding, might encourage bigger guys like me to run back on our heels (and wind up making my back hurt more from that habit in general).  For me the cradling effect that surrounds my foot by fusing the tongue like a webbed foot to the shoe (but its not tight or uncomfortable, in fact its the opposite, it makes you feel your foot is securely protected and makes you think less about obsessing over adjusting the top laces, or using the very top lace holes to thread or the ""normal' top hole of sneakers to thread the laces through and tie them (double or single knot? Double normally for me but with these I felt I could run without my laces tied and I might not care as my foot was well in place with the laces being merely an extra nice touch that they are tied-but maybe not necessary other than to feel slightly more tight (as my feet are big, wide and arches fairly high so top of my big feet make me a heavy Clydesdale, runner at 235-240...so for cushioning and support for bigger runners Mizuno has a higher end sneaker to Creation Wave Inspires at $229. and usually a lmited number available on Zappos or even Amazon, I only have owned 2 pairs of those and they are like more expensive verions of the Wave Creations as they are similar in design only more strongly framed and perhaps they can handle an even larger weight though they also do not cushion so much as support a larger runner to run with better form...so you might look into those if your over 235-240 as the Creations are near their limit I think at around my weight, though someone may review and prove me wrong here...
    .I am never going to be fast, or competitive runner, but I do  appreciate a supportive shoe that respects runners of all levels, and Mizuno may not sell a model that is the comfort equivalent of  the Brooks  Beast,( or a NB 990]994s?)  that seem to attract all the  bigger heavier runners ...but it does have the Wave Creation for us pretty. big guys and for the really big guys I would recommend their Wave Prophecies- as those are both very solid running shoes for Clydesdale runners and bigger and heavier runners needing serious shoes.  Hope this helps somebody as I find very few big guy reviews and this is one of them in a shoe that is good for medium size guys to big heavier guys but not going to be a comfort shoe, its a shoe that is comfortable enough to use if you run with reasonable form and know what its design gives you. You likely will want another pair for days when your back hurts and the Hoka One Cavus or Beasts or Nike AirMax might offer that type of heel strike impact aborbant comfort that these do not provide but will help you avoid needing the comfort runners if you use them before you let yourself hurt your back by running in bad shoes with bad form. Cheers!"

and I extended my first few runs in them, which I’ve never been able to do before.  I would consider myself an avid runner, but I plan to increase my running regiment based on the comfort

I've been buying the max road series for years, and every update is better than the last. This one is completely different. The look, the materials, the ankle collar, the outsole and the cushioning have all dramatically changed. There is a strange angle to the heel as well that took some getting used to. At first I was disappointed. I've been using them a couple of months now and I like them. The cushioning is definitely not as cushy which may be an issue for those with foot or joint issues. They are comfortable, and as long as you don't expect a shoe anything like the Max Road 3 you may like it too."

These shoes don't have the typical unattached tongue--it is attached to the sides of the shoe, so you can't just loosen the laces to insert your foot.

I have kind of painful feet, and Saucony is the brand that seems to fit me the best, while also having the specs I need in a walking shoe, which is what I use running shoes for.  The low heel-to-toe drop of the old Triumph 11, the Zealot ISO and now this Ride ISO2 is exactly what I need.  But unlike those models, these are incredibly cushy.  The midsole cushioning is a revelation, as is the lack of weight and large footprint of the Triumph ISO3s I also have.  The energy return is better than any shoe in any brand I've ever worn.  I could just walk and walk, and my feet don't kill me.  And they're a such good-looking shoes in the black color.  As much as I admire the flash and neon colors of other running shoes, I'm not a flashy person. 
 What a fantastic shoe - I love them.  Grab them while you can because as sure as the sun comes up, Saucony will change them next season."

I thought maybe it was just a different kind of support and came back to try it on three different times before I decided to return it. It’s a shame because I really wanted to like it."

So the heal area is cheapened and weakened a little with the mesh outer.   Some bean counter probley Oked to small tongue too.  Then they plaster Made in the USA all over these. Give me a break! You keep cheaping these shoes that you want a FORTUNE FOR.  They is no noticeable technology about this shoe. The footbed has good support and is wide but there is nothing spectacular about the insole softness.   You could get away with some $60 Sketchers.   I also buy very expensive Clarks and other high quality shoes. 

I am keeping them because of other statements about foot support but that is the only reason. I dont mind paying for a quality shoe but these dont impress me."

Soles on these shoes have a very nice shock-absorbing property for long runs, or for me, a person who tends to strike the ground hard. I liked them, but returned them because of about 5mm excess material where the tongue is sewn to the shoe; it bunches and irritates the top of the foot. Too bad. My suggestion?  The soles of the Duo married to the uppers of the Torin would produce a perfect high-stack, light-weight shoe. Call it the Durin ...  (I own over ten different Altra shoes.)"

New Balance shoes have always been a half size larger than the majority of all my other shoes so I knew what size to order when buying the 1080v9. They arrived and fit perfectly.  They are great shoe for walking on smooth and even terrain like streets, hardpacked sand or gravel trails or other walking areas available to the general public.  I wouldn't recommend them for off road trails unless they are well maintained and free of buried rocks or roots across trails.  Wet and mossy trails are also a problem like we have up here in the Pacific Northwest.  Otherwise, a great shoe for walking and trying to stay active and in shape.  I use these only for walking and not for basic day to day wear.  I am sure they would be no problem but if you are a big guy/girl in the plus 200lb range then don't expect them to last a long time."

Prior to purchasing the Fresh Foam More, I had worn the 1080v8.    The first time I wore the Fresh Foam More, I could tell it was a very tight fit.  I ordered the EE wide.  The fit was perfect in the 1080v8, but way too tight in the Fresh Foam More.  In addition, for whatever reason, wearing it caused my feet to hurt.  It simply did not fit comfortably.  Personally, I liked the style, but the fit was bad.  I decided to go back to the updated 1080v9."

The cushioning is just the right amount for those long easy runs. The upper fits comfortably and the breathability is what can be expected from this type of material. The only down size is the Heel Collar. The way the stitch is made rubbed against my Achilles and created a blister after my first run. Granted I run in low show socks so from now on I will wear a longer sock with this show.

I have consistency been a ""12"" which they equate to a 47EU (which is nuts) - 12 is a 45EU. Anyways the 2.0 is def more snug and smaller.

It's tighter in the heel - which I like, but also very tight in the mid section. I had to go a half size up to tolerate wearing them for more than a few hours. 

Beyond the ""fit"" they are still my go to travel and casual sneakers. I get a lot of compliments on them."

They break in quickly, are incredibly comfortable and hold up better than 80% of the running shoes I've owned. I can say without hesitation that I've loved every pair. 

Until now. 

With this pair, the padded material at the top of the right shoe's Heel Counter caused a blister to form the first day I wore them. I figured it was break-in related and continued wearing them with adhesive blister protectors over my Achilles tendon for another week. It's been almost two months now and I still have to wear a blister protector at the top of my right heel when wearing these shoes. 

My luck with ON shoes has been great in the past so hopefully mine is an isolated problem. I still believe ON makes some of the best running shoes out there and I will continue to support the brand."

I wore them for a 7-mile walk last night and my feet were only slightly sore toward the end. I do wish there were more color choices than just black or light gray, but they are quite attractive."

I purchased and ultimately returned after a couple runs. I REALLY wanted to keep them but couldn’t because of 2-3 problems. Will I purchase the Duo 2+?, yes and hope for the best.

1. As mentioned in reviews from multiple sites, there is a problem with the tongue. As patient as I was willing to be to get the tongue seated after putting the shoe on my foot, I couldn’t see spending 10 minutes every time to put them on, but I loved the idea of having that cushion on long runs as I hope to build back up to marathons & ultras in the next year.

2. I have the Torin 4. Amazing shoe. I consider it my ‘race’ shoe, but wanted a training shoe for my aging 45 yr old body-thus the Duo1.5. They are two completely different cuts. Compare the pictures. The Duo hurt the width of my foot, not my toes, after a couple miles despite adjustments to the laces during the jogs and even re-lacing to try and allow the shoe to let my foot spread so-to-speak.

3. The tongue & upper in the pair I had was simply shoddy construction with choppy long pieces left attached above your toes. 

4. It was just ever so slightly loose in the heel, but with adjustments, I could seat my heel. 

There are still some really nice and interesting qualities of the shoe:
A. The sole was substantial! And would really grab the surfaces. Wow! I actually thought I may not run through the sole.
B. The weird thing about the mesh upper outlined with flat rubber edging(?) is it locked your foot and into the shoe. I could see potential for the shoe could completely disappear from thought as you run in them. It like it could be a second skin and might feel great sock-less. I’m a sock guy. 
C. The midsole was wonderful. Straight up comfy cushion. 

Hope this helps."

The Escalante is just about perfect for me. This is my third pair.
I like the new material in the uppers better than the open mesh of the earlier models -- sand pours in through the older mesh at the beach. If the new upper is a bit heavier for that, I can accept the trade-off.
I also like the low cushion in this model because I like to feel the ground as I run.  I do anticipate that the smoother tread pattern (vs. earlier model) will make it more difficult to see 'tread wear' patterns for analyzing gait symmetry, braking, and landing zones.  But it is less likely to pick up mud and grit that might get tracked into the house.  See photo for both tread pattern and typical grit.  Always trade offs."

The plan was to use them for my long outdoor runs to help remedy my foot problem.  Super plush, lots of underfoot protection.  Not the fastest shoe, since this level of cushioning bleeds off your thrust and efficiency, but they are super light.  Most importantly, I can finish a 10-12 mile run in these, and my feet still feel pretty fresh.  Very well protected.

The fit is tighter and not as comfortable as Rev-4, the angle of the foot is different and not as comfortable, and the sole looks more like a platform.

My only issue was that for my normal size, the toe (box) area of the show is a bit narrow, causing my big toe to contact the outside of the shore more than other (New Balance) styles.  I felt this might cause rubbing of the big tow after hours of wear.  So, I reluctantly sent them back.  My advice - give them a try.  Also, I think the show has great style."

With this Ghost 12, however, the shoes definitely feel narrower (particularly in the toe box) - not horribly tighter, but definitely snugger than the 11s (and maybe slightly shorter too).  So, I'm having to buy up the available 11s and hope that Brooks fixes things in a year with the 13s.  I also don't like the new design/look as much as the 11s."

I have been running with these new shoes for nearly two months and still love the shoe. My previous shoe was a Nike Zoom Odyssey 2. I really liked them but a good friend suggested I try the Hoka brand. Glad I did. These shoes with all the cushioning are still lighter than the Zooms.  I'm 70 years old and these shoes are just what I need to keep me on the trails.  One concern was that the extra layers would lead to wobbly ankle twists but no issues.  I'd buy another pair.
I did enjoy the Hoka website and shoe description of the different running shoes. I chose two that sounded like me and picked the Clifton 6."

There is very little arch support in these, nor is there support (a “bump”) in the middle-front to open the toes a bit. That’s what my custom insoles do. Everyone’s feet are different, so why not allow for customized insoles? Just my two cents. Otherwise these would be great shoes."

These shoes don't have the typical unattached tongue--it is attached to the sides of the shoe, so you can't just loosen the laces to insert your foot.

Now all is good. Try the Sorbathane insole with the 10mm arch basically flat and very comfortable. Takes a tad more space than the one that comes with the shoe, good for my narrow feet.

It's a waking city, and walk everywhere, to and from work, to Central Park, shopping and bopping.

The 990 is a legendary shoe, and the V5 has made subtle improvements. The arch and footbed support is improved over the V4. The tongue has much more padding. The side support is better. It might not be the sleekest runner ever, but it's a classic. I can spend the entire day in my 990's and my feet feel fresh.

Zappos and their customer service consistently blow me away. Same thing with my friends. There are a few companies that have fantastic customer service...Bose and T-Mobile come to mind, but Zappos is the standard."

Overall, the shoe looks and feels similar to the 35. However, one subtle change that significantly affected fit was the rubber overlay around the top edge of the toe box. It is between 1/2 and 3/4 of an inch and goes from one side of the ball of your foot over the top of the ends of your toes and back down the other side to the ball of your foot. In speaking with Nike they said it was to provide some additional support. What I found it prevented my toes from expanding and made the toe box feel tighter. I liked previous versions because I have 10 4E feet so the shoes always fit and allowed my toes to expand. Unfortunately because of this small change I had to return the shoes and will be looking for a new everyday running shoe."

The store gave me a deal because I was their only customer who could wear them. They were the only shoes I ever had that truly fit until the magic of online shopping allowed me to find such shoes again. Even so, they are few and far between. In fact, these are the first running shoes I’ve seen. I usually settle for B’s. I walk 5-7 miles a day on NYC sidewalks, so I need a good shoe. These fit the bill for that so far. I’ve only worn them for about 3 weeks. I’ll see how long they last, but my previous, cheaper pairs of New Balance have done well. I usually can get my 10.5 foot into an 11 NB B-width. These required a full size bigger. My foot fits like a glove. At first, I thought they were too narrow and then I removed the extra pair of socks that I always wear in all my other shoes. Perfect!  Gave style 4 stars only because I really wanted a pair of whites and I had a choice between black and black. I admit that I get tired of the NB logo, too. But I’m grateful to the company for filling a very small market niche. There are not a lot of men’s AA feet out there.  P.S. It’s a little thing. I’ve been double-tying running shoes for years because the furshligginer laces keep untying. These are hard to UNTIE when I double-tie them, but when I single-tie them, they usually stay tied. May their tribe increase."

These Cohesions are certainly not going to become my #1, but the fact that I can do shorter runs in them really is a compliment.  The style of the shoe is not great though.

They really do hit a sweet spot that Nike hasn’t been able to hit for me - reasonably priced, comfortable, and versatile shoes I can mix runs around in. I enjoy running in these a lot, and would recommend. They tend to hold sweat/water more than the thinner material of the Nikes, but that appears to be the only real drawback (and I’m nitpicking)."

apart from other models.  I typically have a tough time breaking in running shoes, dealing with blistering for the first few wears.  With the Levitate 2, the break-in period was non-existent
and I extended my first few runs in them, which I’ve never been able to do before.  I would consider myself an avid runner, but I plan to increase my running regiment based on the comfort 
of this shoe.  Much like the original, it’s lightweight and seems to work well with my flat feet.  Excited to see what additional color ways they plan to launch."

The store gave me a deal because I was their only customer who could wear them. They were the only shoes I ever had that truly fit until the magic of online shopping allowed me to find such shoes again. Even so, they are few and far between. In fact, these are the first running shoes I’ve seen. I usually settle for B’s. I walk 5-7 miles a day on NYC sidewalks, so I need a good shoe. These fit the bill for that so far. I’ve only worn them for about 3 weeks. I’ll see how long they last, but my previous, cheaper pairs of New Balance have done well. I usually can get my 10.5 foot into an 11 NB B-width. These required a full size bigger. My foot fits like a glove. At first, I thought they were too narrow and then I removed the extra pair of socks that I always wear in all my other shoes. Perfect!  Gave style 4 stars only because I really wanted a pair of whites and I had a choice between black and black. I admit that I get tired of the NB logo, too. But I’m grateful to the company for filling a very small market niche. There are not a lot of men’s AA feet out there.  P.S. It’s a little thing. I’ve been double-tying running shoes for years because the furshligginer laces keep untying. These are hard to UNTIE when I double-tie them, but when I single-tie them, they usually stay tied. May their tribe increase."

This pair has a hole now (inner lining near the heel, exposing plastic), 4 months after purchase. They were not worn every day, maybe every other day for an hour or two. They should not wear out this quickly, but in my experience, all Hokas do wear out this quickly. The sole material also compresses pretty fast, making them much less cushy in just a few months. Overall, I still like these shoes because they are really comfortable, but I'm finding the value lacking. For $100-$150+, a shoe should last *at least* 6-8 months."

I love how these shoes fit my feet like a glove. I normally wear a 9.5, that's the size I ordered, and that's the size I would stick with.

I chose the primer/ebony/black color combo and love how they look in person. I also love the woven material used in the shoe -- really cool texture and very breathable.

I used to wear Nike shoes almost exclusively (they do make great shoes), but I am now very much a Brooks fan. I highly recommend the Revel 3 (even if you're a walker and not a runner)."

The store gave me a deal because I was their only customer who could wear them. They were the only shoes I ever had that truly fit until the magic of online shopping allowed me to find such shoes again. Even so, they are few and far between. In fact, these are the first running shoes I’ve seen. I usually settle for B’s. I walk 5-7 miles a day on NYC sidewalks, so I need a good shoe. These fit the bill for that so far. I’ve only worn them for about 3 weeks. I’ll see how long they last, but my previous, cheaper pairs of New Balance have done well. I usually can get my 10.5 foot into an 11 NB B-width. These required a full size bigger. My foot fits like a glove. At first, I thought they were too narrow and then I removed the extra pair of socks that I always wear in all my other shoes. Perfect!  Gave style 4 stars only because I really wanted a pair of whites and I had a choice between black and black. I admit that I get tired of the NB logo, too. But I’m grateful to the company for filling a very small market niche. There are not a lot of men’s AA feet out there.  P.S. It’s a little thing. I’ve been double-tying running shoes for years because the furshligginer laces keep untying. These are hard to UNTIE when I double-tie them, but when I single-tie them, they usually stay tied. May their tribe increase."

There is very little arch support in these, nor is there support (a “bump”) in the middle-front to open the toes a bit. That’s what my custom insoles do.

New Balance completely missed the mark on this one, especially for the price.  For starters the sole began to wear out after 3 or 4 jogs.  The added rubber sole inserts are completely worn down on the heel after only about a month of use and I alternated these shoes with 2 other pairs of Altras.  The worst part, however, are the insoles.  They are paper thin and do not stay in place even when casually walking around my house.  They ride back and gather behind my heels.  This past weekend I wore the shoes for a 3 mile walk and rubbed a blister on my right big toe due to the insole riding back and my toe rubbing on the edge of the insole and the bottom of the shoe.  

Lastly, the heel cup is very odd fitting and no matter which size shoe I tried, my heel slipped a bit.  Aside from looking good, these shoes are not worth it."

The 990 is a legendary shoe, and the V5 has made subtle improvements. The arch and footbed support is improved over the V4. The tongue has much more padding. The side support is better. It might not be the sleekest runner ever, but it's a classic. I can spend the entire day in my 990's and my feet feel fresh.

Zappos and their customer service consistently blow me away. Same thing with my friends. There are a few companies that have fantastic customer service...Bose and T-Mobile come to mind, but Zappos is the standard."

The Beast 18 fits just like the Beast 14.  I'm back to a normal size, the massive arch support is in the right position, and it just feels right.  I could feel my knees relax on my first run with them.  It seems weird, but trust me.

The Escalante is just about perfect for me. This is my third pair.
I like the new material in the uppers better than the open mesh of the earlier models -- sand pours in through the older mesh at the beach. If the new upper is a bit heavier for that, I can accept the trade-off.
I also like the low cushion in this model because I like to feel the ground as I run.  I do anticipate that the smoother tread pattern (vs. earlier model) will make it more difficult to see 'tread wear' patterns for analyzing gait symmetry, braking, and landing zones.  But it is less likely to pick up mud and grit that might get tracked into the house.  See photo for both tread pattern and typical grit.  Always trade offs."

Until now. 

With this pair, the padded material at the top of the right shoe's Heel Counter caused a blister to form the first day I wore them. I figured it was break-in related and continued wearing them with adhesive blister protectors over my Achilles tendon for another week. It's been almost two months now and I still have to wear a blister protector at the top of my right heel when wearing these shoes. 

My luck with ON shoes has been great in the past so hopefully mine is an isolated problem. I still believe ON makes some of the best running shoes out there and I will continue to support the brand."

I bought these shoes right before Christmas and have worn them everyday since purchase. I no longer have pain in my foot/heel. It's a miracle!

Why?! Why did you take what was probably the best shoe you made, treated with care and designed to unwavering specificity and throw it in the generic pile?! I was quite literally in love with the Addiction line since the 11 series. It's been the only shoe I've bought for years now, because major design cues have been maintained. Your toe box has shrunk (I'm wearing EE), the shoe has gotten straighter (think Nike, thus making the shoe feel a half size smaller, I'm a 15) the design has gotten bland, the tread has gone from pleasantly aggressive to vomitously generic, the laces are too short to use every grommet, and most importantly, the HEEL COLLAR HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY! this baffles me above all things. You've gone to a pointed collar that irritates the Achilles tendon rather than the double point that allows for free movement of the tendon with a lobe of cushion locked to either side. This was one of the best points Brooks ever scored in my book. I've been forced to exchange for Beast 16's in order to maintain that design feature because you've ALSO pointed the collar on the new Beast 18's!! I've seen this trend throughout the other shoes in your line as well, and I'm disappointed. No other brand really addresses the pronation I experience, and as a man who is 7 ft tall, 325 lbs and is on his feet all day that's saying something. I was a brooks lover for life, I can only hope that continues..."

I've been wearing Wave Riders for years and they always worked perfectly with my foot. This new design is shorter and has a smaller toe box. I started getting toe pain, which lead to mid arch pain. 

I bought a pair of the older style and less than a week in most of my pain has disappeared. This might be a good shoe but it is not the old model.

If you are a fan of the older style it might be worth finding a pair."

Until now. 

With this pair, the padded material at the top of the right shoe's Heel Counter caused a blister to form the first day I wore them. I figured it was break-in related and continued wearing them with adhesive blister protectors over my Achilles tendon for another week. It's been almost two months now and I still have to wear a blister protector at the top of my right heel when wearing these shoes. 

My luck with ON shoes has been great in the past so hopefully mine is an isolated problem. I still believe ON makes some of the best running shoes out there and I will continue to support the brand."

I ordered my husband a pair in size 11 which is the size he typically wears in Adidas, and they were huge! Ordered a 10.5, and the length was still too long. He opted not to order another pair even smaller because even though the length was so long, the opening to insert his foot was quite small and tight. These shoes don't have the typical unattached tongue--it is attached to the sides of the shoe, so you can't just loosen the laces to insert your foot.

This was noticeable when stationary but wasn't much of an issue when on the move. The new top gives a much more secure feel while still breathable. These would be great as running shoes but don't plan on using it as a daily 24/7 shoe. You may not notice that it is restricting your feet at first but after half an hour or longer, you'll want to take them off to let your feet spay out. This feels more like a normal shoe with zero drop rather than the large open toe box of Altra. I have fairly narrow feet also, which makes me think it would be even worse for most people. Sizing up half a size may fix this but may also cause other issues such as heel slippage. The heel in the back does go up higher. This will probably give more secure fit but it also rubs a bit more than the 1.5 did. The midsole is a little more firm, which I actually preferred. It won't have as soft on initial feel but I think it provides better comfort/support beyond the initial 15 mins. The bottom has more foam removed for areas that would bend to give it more flexibility but the rubber sole has basically no threads. It is very slippery on wet and smooth surfaces. My year olf 1.5s had better grip than these 2.0 brand new. Overall, I am disappointed with the revision. On initial try, I thought this would be my new favorite shoe as it felt much more secure than the 1.5 did. The restrictive top material on the toebox was the deal breaker for me. These no longer feel like Altras as my toes felt squished together."

Like all Altras, these are zero drop; if you are not used to it, take your time to transition - your Achilles will thank you. Also, they have minimal cushioning, so proper running form is absolutely required. With that out of the way...

These shoes are awesome. Light, fast, comfortable. I'm completely in love with them. I'm an avid runner who burned through several pairs of Altras, and these are by far the ones I like the most."

apart from other models.  I typically have a tough time breaking in running shoes, dealing with blistering for the first few wears.  With the Levitate 2, the break-in period was non-existent
and I extended my first few runs in them, which I’ve never been able to do before.  I would consider myself an avid runner, but I plan to increase my running regiment based on the comfort 
of this shoe.  Much like the original, it’s lightweight and seems to work well with my flat feet.  Excited to see what additional color ways they plan to launch."

They were fantastic for the first 8-9 miles, but by mile 10 I had a horrendous hotfoot in the left shoe and really struggled to finish the race.

I have been a New Balance 990 guy for the last twenty or so years. I was ready to push the button here on v5 when a little more hipper spirit nudged me over to the Brooks' side of Zappos. 

While in Brooksville, I travelled to where the Adrenalines hang out.  They looked cool, light, comfy, and came in widths. I chose the stealth black 13 4E. 

I speed walk with my Labrador Retriever 6 miles a day and I'm happy to say I may be faster, certainly more comfortable, and obviously overjoyed in my selection. And yes, I'm coming back for more Adrenaline (Black / Lime and Black / Ketchup) ; one pair for my birthday, and one pair for Christmas.

I've been shopping at Zappos for about 10 years and, ladies and gentlemen, you have not let me down once. I actually look forward to returning shoes (wrong sizes) so I can hang with the customer service folks.

Thanks much for making this guy's shoe buying journey more enjoyable."

I wear women’s size 10.5 or 11 but have needed to move to men’s sizing for more room in the toe box. This version of adrenaline is not good, the toe box is narrow and there is no cushion. Last year I changed to ghost 11 womens 10.5 which was super comfortable but mid year the fit was changed to more narrow. This seems to be the trend with Brooks. The wide sizes, which are limited, are just too big in the heel and instep. I don’t understand who the running  shoe companies are targeting with all the narrow shoes on the market. Back to New Balance."

Now for the actual shoes. As I read while shopping around, I can confirm that these shoes are big, decently larger than normal running shoes. Due to that, they give off a “dad vibe” and I would never wear these other than for the purpose of running. The pictures I uploaded are compared to my 3 year old On Clouds for size comparison and you can see they are substantially larger. The toe box is wide which works for me because I feel I’m too wide for a regular shoe and too narrow for a wide shoe. I never buy anything other than normal width shoes size wide shoes are way too wide, and I often feel the side of my feet bunch against the side walls. These shoes are comfortable when running. The dual layer of clouds is nice if you’re a runner whose heel hits first as I do. No matter how much I try to alter, I always resort back to a natural heel, toe, heel, toe stride when running and my heels would hurt after runs of 5 miles or more. After a 5 mile run the other day, no heel pain. Since the shoe is bigger, you can notice the additional weight compared to other On shoes, and the back of the shoe rides higher up the heel. My heel was rubbed raw after my first run while wearing no show socks. During my second run, I wore low cut socks as opposed to no shows, and I didn’t tighten the top laces as tight and didn’t have an issue with the heel. I’m going to keep them but I will probably go back to the normal sized On shoes after I wear these out. I will update if anything changes."

I wear custom fit orthotics, and they fit ok in both shoes.  The Arahi felt slightly longer and slightly wider to my feet than the Graviota even though the description and reviews say the Arahi is a narrower shoe.

I did quite a lot of research for a quality running shoe. Unfortunately most highly rated or recommended running shoes are either too expensive or the affordable ones seems to have dropped in quality in more recent additions. I finally found these as one of the best recommended affordable running shoes that still were top quality performers. Good price and good quality shoe. I had to go a half size down to get the right fit but otherwise they have been great. I have never worn Reebok and I can't say I have ever been a fan of the brand or style. But I love these.

Overall, the shoe looks and feels similar to the 35. However, one subtle change that significantly affected fit was the rubber overlay around the top edge of the toe box. It is between 1/2 and 3/4 of an inch and goes from one side of the ball of your foot over the top of the ends of your toes and back down the other side to the ball of your foot. In speaking with Nike they said it was to provide some additional support. What I found it prevented my toes from expanding and made the toe box feel tighter. I liked previous versions because I have 10 4E feet so the shoes always fit and allowed my toes to expand. Unfortunately because of this small change I had to return the shoes and will be looking for a new everyday running shoe."

The store gave me a deal because I was their only customer who could wear them. They were the only shoes I ever had that truly fit until the magic of online shopping allowed me to find such shoes again. Even so, they are few and far between. In fact, these are the first running shoes I’ve seen. I usually settle for B’s. I walk 5-7 miles a day on NYC sidewalks, so I need a good shoe. These fit the bill for that so far. I’ve only worn them for about 3 weeks. I’ll see how long they last, but my previous, cheaper pairs of New Balance have done well. I usually can get my 10.5 foot into an 11 NB B-width. These required a full size bigger. My foot fits like a glove. At first, I thought they were too narrow and then I removed the extra pair of socks that I always wear in all my other shoes. Perfect!  Gave style 4 stars only because I really wanted a pair of whites and I had a choice between black and black. I admit that I get tired of the NB logo, too. But I’m grateful to the company for filling a very small market niche. There are not a lot of men’s AA feet out there.  P.S. It’s a little thing. I’ve been double-tying running shoes for years because the furshligginer laces keep untying. These are hard to UNTIE when I double-tie them, but when I single-tie them, they usually stay tied. May their tribe increase."

I have been a New Balance 990 guy for the last twenty or so years. I was ready to push the button here on v5 when a little more hipper spirit nudged me over to the Brooks' side of Zappos. 

While in Brooksville, I travelled to where the Adrenalines hang out.  They looked cool, light, comfy, and came in widths. I chose the stealth black 13 4E. 

I speed walk with my Labrador Retriever 6 miles a day and I'm happy to say I may be faster, certainly more comfortable, and obviously overjoyed in my selection. And yes, I'm coming back for more Adrenaline (Black / Lime and Black / Ketchup) ; one pair for my birthday, and one pair for Christmas.

I've been shopping at Zappos for about 10 years and, ladies and gentlemen, you have not let me down once. I actually look forward to returning shoes (wrong sizes) so I can hang with the customer service folks.

Thanks much for making this guy's shoe buying journey more enjoyable."

In the past year I developed some heel pain and Achilles tendonitis, particularly in the right foot.  I never dreamed of buying a pair of these modified walking boots (my nickname for them), but I tried them on in a store, and just had to have them.  The plan was to use them for my long outdoor runs to help remedy my foot problem.  Super plush, lots of underfoot protection.  Not the fastest shoe, since this level of cushioning bleeds off your thrust and efficiency, but they are super light.  Most importantly, I can finish a 10-12 mile run in these, and my feet still feel pretty fresh.  Very well protected.  Working these into my shoe rotation has helped me recover enough that my weekly mileage has returned to what it was over a year ago.  Not the most attractive shoe with that thick slab of foam, but running in them has a therapeutic quality to it.  Super comfortable ride."

This pair has a hole now (inner lining near the heel, exposing plastic), 4 months after purchase. They were not worn every day, maybe every other day for an hour or two. They should not wear out this quickly, but in my experience, all Hokas do wear out this quickly. The sole material also compresses pretty fast, making them much less cushy in just a few months. Overall, I still like these shoes because they are really comfortable, but I'm finding the value lacking. For $100-$150+, a shoe should last *at least* 6-8 months."

It gives room for my toes to naturally splay and feel comfortable without being pinched with a traditional tool box design. The heal I found to be too abrasive and snug. The lack of cushion and the stitching was uncomfortable. I wore my usual socks which are the Injinji brand and it was just too uncomfortable to wear. If there was more cushioning around the heel I would have enjoyed wearing the shoes more.

I have always had better luck with ASICS than with any other brand.  As a heavier runner, I find the levels of support and cushioning in the Kayano perfectly suited to my frame.  My only complaint is a petty one.  I wear a 4E width, and I am profoundly grateful to ASICS for manufacturing this top-tier shoe in my width.  I understand that the 4E market is very small, so it is unrealistic to ask for all color schemes to be available in 4E widths.   But I just wish that once in a while they would make the 4E width available in one of the more exciting color schemes.  Typically, the 4E width is only available in the blandest color scheme produced.  As I said, it is a petty complaint, and I can live with the bland colors as long as the shoes permit me to continue running injury-free."

It was only an issue aesthetically, but once the heels wore down as well, this shoe became a disaster.

Due to price, instead of keeping both, decided to go with the Graviota at this time and will be returning the Arahi. The  Arahi is a nice stability shoe, slightly lighter in weight than the Graviota, slightly less support, or a different feel to the support than the Graviota.  I wear custom fit orthotics, and they fit ok in both shoes.  The Arahi felt slightly longer and slightly wider to my feet than the Graviota even though the description and reviews say the Arahi is a narrower shoe.  The Graviota feels like it has more cushioning than the Arahi.  For my foot, the Graviota gives a nice, snug, supportive fit.  First time purchasing Hoka, so curious how they will last in comparison to my Brooks and New Balance."

Before the Nimbus 17s I had a pair of Cumulus 16s, which I liked a lot, but they weren't cushioned enough, especially in the forefoot. These Cumulus 21s are much better than the Cumulus 16s. Lots of room in the toe box and the overall fit is great. I still somewhat prefer the Nimubus 17s for their great forefoot comfort, but overall the Cumulus 21s are very good."

These were the only rocker bottom running shoes I found and they were perfect.  They allow me to run with more of a shuffle gait and still get some push off without putting weight on the big toe.  Hard to understand why there wasn't more discussion about these shoes on the internet when I did my search.  If you have this problem you should try these shoes.

I really liked them but a good friend suggested I try the Hoka brand. Glad I did. These shoes with all the cushioning are still lighter than the Zooms.  I'm 70 years old and these shoes are just what I need to keep me on the trails.  One concern was that the extra layers would lead to wobbly ankle twists but no issues.  I'd buy another pair.
I did enjoy the Hoka website and shoe description of the different running shoes. I chose two that sounded like me and picked the Clifton 6."

I feel like the sizing is accurate for me, a 14 feels like every other 14. The width is fine for my slightly narrow feet. I’ve been on a couple shorter runs and one long run thus far. I don’t notice the rocker at all. I have noticed extra strain in my ankles and calves during and after runs, but my feet, knees, and back love these shoes.

I took these for a spin on the trails two days in a row and they didn't really require any breaking in, probably because I am already familiar with the platform and ride of the road version.  They felt light and responsive, so I can imagine that they will be good to race in as well.

This pair has a hole now (inner lining near the heel, exposing plastic), 4 months after purchase. They were not worn every day, maybe every other day for an hour or two. They should not wear out this quickly, but in my experience, all Hokas do wear out this quickly. The sole material also compresses pretty fast, making them much less cushy in just a few months. Overall, I still like these shoes because they are really comfortable, but I'm finding the value lacking. For $100-$150+, a shoe should last *at least* 6-8 months."

This pair has a hole now (inner lining near the heel, exposing plastic), 4 months after purchase. They were not worn every day, maybe every other day for an hour or two. They should not wear out this quickly, but in my experience, all Hokas do wear out this quickly. The sole material also compresses pretty fast, making them much less cushy in just a few months. Overall, I still like these shoes because they are really comfortable, but I'm finding the value lacking. For $100-$150+, a shoe should last *at least* 6-8 months."

I spent a week walking around and running in these shoes. My feet were hurting as it felt like pressure was being put on the ball of the foot or base of the toes due to that feeling of minimal support in the mid-foot. I liked the look but returned the shoes and went with Brooks Adrenaline which has cushy support for the entire foot.

Why Altra did you radically alter one of your best shoes?  I received these shoes about a week ago and went for two runs in them,  one short 3 mile break-in run, and a longer 10K run. The 10K run seriously tore up my big toe on my  left foot.  Analyzing why, the new fabric they are using that makes them ""plush"" bunches up where you foot bends the toe box.  The left shoe bunched up inwards and made contact with my toe. The styling looks nice, but the shoelaces are ridiculously long. It really annoys me that Altra changes their shoes styling faster than KIA does their cars. 

As a marathoner I like to stick with a shoe that I know works, is comfortable for the long miles, and because I have big feet I don't usually get a bunch of options. I'm gonna return these shoes because I'm pretty mad they tore up my feet a month before my next Half Marathon race and I don't want to try to wear them anymore.

I wish I could find more of the Torin 3.5's for sale but I'm not holding my breath.  Geesh Altra, you're testing the patience of your loyal runners."

Tried regular On Cloud in a store, and size 10 felt just a tad too tight, and 10.5 we maybe a tad too loose.
Ordered the On Cloud Waterproof in 10.5, and they were just right -- my guess is, due to an extra membrane layer, they are just a bit tighter than their non-waterproof counterpart.

Fit and finish are nothing short of stellar. 
Shoes are laced with an elastic string (not my cup of tea), but regular laces are included in the box.
I'd say the laces are on the shorter side, and definitely too short to lock the heel in (that is, to use all holes at the top of the shoe).

The shoes are very comfortable, but definitely a tad warm, which is to be expected as they are waterproof."

This shoe felt more like a 2E than a 4E, i did everything possible (without) stretching the shoe to 'break it in' nothing worked. Me feet just hurt really badly, so I'm returning them.

I found the wider version of this shoe but what you get is a shoe that is about 1/4 inch longer but there's no real change in width and the section of the shoe that holds the laces will dig into the top of your foot because they are too long.  They also have great arch support but if you have high arches and your ankles turn outward (underpronate or supinate) they might make the problem worse.   The sole of this shoe is so comfortable and infact, my sister who has narrow feet and plantar fasciitis tried them on and ended up ordering her own pair and she loves them.  She no longer has pain in her feet and she has found she can stand for 8 hours at work and not have any issues any longer.   My two stars are for the width otherwise it's a great shoe."

New Balance completely missed the mark on this one, especially for the price.  For starters the sole began to wear out after 3 or 4 jogs.  The added rubber sole inserts are completely worn down on the heel after only about a month of use and I alternated these shoes with 2 other pairs of Altras.  The worst part, however, are the insoles.  They are paper thin and do not stay in place even when casually walking around my house.  They ride back and gather behind my heels.  This past weekend I wore the shoes for a 3 mile walk and rubbed a blister on my right big toe due to the insole riding back and my toe rubbing on the edge of the insole and the bottom of the shoe.  

Lastly, the heel cup is very odd fitting and no matter which size shoe I tried, my heel slipped a bit.  Aside from looking good, these shoes are not worth it."

I have been running with these new shoes for nearly two months and still love the shoe. My previous shoe was a Nike Zoom Odyssey 2. I really liked them but a good friend suggested I try the Hoka brand. Glad I did. These shoes with all the cushioning are still lighter than the Zooms.  I'm 70 years old and these shoes are just what I need to keep me on the trails.  One concern was that the extra layers would lead to wobbly ankle twists but no issues.  I'd buy another pair.
I did enjoy the Hoka website and shoe description of the different running shoes. I chose two that sounded like me and picked the Clifton 6."

I bought these to replace a pair of Hoka Clifton 4’s that I have been wearing over a year. When I realized I had bought a size 10 Men’s shoe instead of women’s size 10, I thought I would have to return them immediately, but they feel great, and are only barely longer than my women’s size 10.5. I got the black and love them. The thick sole in these have been cleverly disguised by the two tone sole, so they look more minimalist than they are. Unfortunately while they are extremely light and flexible, they are not as supportive as even my old, worn out Clifton’s so I am considering returning them for the Clifton 6. I will be sad to see them go, though. I love the look and feel, but need more arch support."

Maybe it's just me, I really haven't purchased a pair of running shoes in some time. These don't seem very supportive, they seem to emphasize comfort, in a pillowy kind of way. I'm used to feeling support, all over, and I never really feel it with these shoes. They took about a week to break in (not too difficult, mind you), and you'll need to re-set the laces to fit you more comfortably. I would not buy these again, though I'm not looking to return them either - because I'm going to use them as casual wear, and not as running shoes. I think my next pair will probably be Brooks, my original running shoe of years ago. The fit and finish is good, not great."

I think it’s probably the best Beast yet, with its enlarged toe box, comfortable and very breathable engineered mesh, and well reinforced heel counter. The rather thick sole (an apparently growing trend with shoe makers like Hoka and others, who take it to more extremes) provides the perfect levels of stability and movement control, even for users who don’t suffer from severe over-pronation.

I was curious to find out how the slightly lighter new Brooks 20 compared. Like the 18, its engineered mesh upper is comfortable and even a bit mor spacious. The heel counter is toned down but still adequate. So far so good. 

Buts it’s the new guide-rails, popular on so many other new Brooks shoes, that fail as a replacement for the more grounded and stable sole support system of earlier Beasts, including the 18. The 20 and it’s guide rails Just doesn’t provide anything close to the stability and sure-footedness as its 18 predecessor for my large 6’2” frame.

i’m now quite happy that I purchased quite a few 18s in my size."

I am not a runner, but use these as everyday walk around shoes. I'm not a big fan of the styling, but wanted a newer pair. These are not as comfortable as my previous Free RN's. The heel is kind of chunky, which is obvious from looking at them, and I feel like I'm leaning forward while wearing them. This may be a design feature for their intended use of jogging, but as a walking around shoe, not as good as the previous versions in my opinion. Not uncomfortable enough to return."

I truly hope they do make a shoe next that has even more squish to the cushion and my only real gripe would be the tongue was like scratchy without socks when I first tried them on. So as a slip on and do something quick kind of messed that up but with socks The shoe is awesome. But please fix the tongue and add more squish to the cushion and I think this would beat 95% of comfort shoes on the market. God bless

I've been wearing the Beasts since ~2010 and get a new pair every year.  The Beast 16 was too small, too narrow, and fell apart easily (the front started to wear quickly).  I'm normally an 11.5 2E in nearly every shoe, but the Beast 16 made me get a 12 E4, and then it didn't feel right.

The Beast 18 fits just like the Beast 14.  I'm back to a normal size, the massive arch support is in the right position, and it just feels right.  I could feel my knees relax on my first run with them.  It seems weird, but trust me. 

If anything, it's worth a shot from Zappos as you can always return them."

Until now. 

With this pair, the padded material at the top of the right shoe's Heel Counter caused a blister to form the first day I wore them. I figured it was break-in related and continued wearing them with adhesive blister protectors over my Achilles tendon for another week. It's been almost two months now and I still have to wear a blister protector at the top of my right heel when wearing these shoes. 

My luck with ON shoes has been great in the past so hopefully mine is an isolated problem. I still believe ON makes some of the best running shoes out there and I will continue to support the brand."

My only complaint is a petty one.  I wear a 4E width, and I am profoundly grateful to ASICS for manufacturing this top-tier shoe in my width.  I understand that the 4E market is very small, so it is unrealistic to ask for all color schemes to be available in 4E widths.   But I just wish that once in a while they would make the 4E width available in one of the more exciting color schemes.  Typically, the 4E width is only available in the blandest color scheme produced.

The store gave me a deal because I was their only customer who could wear them. They were the only shoes I ever had that truly fit until the magic of online shopping allowed me to find such shoes again. Even so, they are few and far between. In fact, these are the first running shoes I’ve seen. I usually settle for B’s. I walk 5-7 miles a day on NYC sidewalks, so I need a good shoe. These fit the bill for that so far. I’ve only worn them for about 3 weeks. I’ll see how long they last, but my previous, cheaper pairs of New Balance have done well. I usually can get my 10.5 foot into an 11 NB B-width. These required a full size bigger. My foot fits like a glove. At first, I thought they were too narrow and then I removed the extra pair of socks that I always wear in all my other shoes. Perfect!  Gave style 4 stars only because I really wanted a pair of whites and I had a choice between black and black. I admit that I get tired of the NB logo, too. But I’m grateful to the company for filling a very small market niche. There are not a lot of men’s AA feet out there.  P.S. It’s a little thing. I’ve been double-tying running shoes for years because the furshligginer laces keep untying. These are hard to UNTIE when I double-tie them, but when I single-tie them, they usually stay tied. May their tribe increase."

I wear women’s size 10.5 or 11 but have needed to move to men’s sizing for more room in the toe box. This version of adrenaline is not good, the toe box is narrow and there is no cushion. Last year I changed to ghost 11 womens 10.5 which was super comfortable but mid year the fit was changed to more narrow. This seems to be the trend with Brooks. The wide sizes, which are limited, are just too big in the heel and instep. I don’t understand who the running  shoe companies are targeting with all the narrow shoes on the market.

I have been a New Balance 990 guy for the last twenty or so years. I was ready to push the button here on v5 when a little more hipper spirit nudged me over to the Brooks' side of Zappos. 

While in Brooksville, I travelled to where the Adrenalines hang out.  They looked cool, light, comfy, and came in widths. I chose the stealth black 13 4E. 

I speed walk with my Labrador Retriever 6 miles a day and I'm happy to say I may be faster, certainly more comfortable, and obviously overjoyed in my selection. And yes, I'm coming back for more Adrenaline (Black / Lime and Black / Ketchup) ; one pair for my birthday, and one pair for Christmas.

I've been shopping at Zappos for about 10 years and, ladies and gentlemen, you have not let me down once. I actually look forward to returning shoes (wrong sizes) so I can hang with the customer service folks.

Thanks much for making this guy's shoe buying journey more enjoyable."

This pair has a hole now (inner lining near the heel, exposing plastic), 4 months after purchase. They were not worn every day, maybe every other day for an hour or two. They should not wear out this quickly, but in my experience, all Hokas do wear out this quickly. The sole material also compresses pretty fast, making them much less cushy in just a few months. Overall, I still like these shoes because they are really comfortable, but I'm finding the value lacking. For $100-$150+, a shoe should last *at least* 6-8 months."

These are also much lighter and the new ""no lacing"" bungees are great, with a nice clean look.
2 things I'm not crazy about: 
1) half of the logo came off the front of the shoe today on the very first wearing! Really, I don't think this has ever happened in my entire life... would think the brand is important enough to stay on the shoe.
2) the sole, especially at the tip of the shoe, is a little slippery in the rain, even on asphalt. As I'm walking, not running, I can feel the slippage as I step."

and I extended my first few runs in them, which I’ve never been able to do before.  I would consider myself an avid runner, but I plan to increase my running regiment based on the comfort

I have been a New Balance 990 guy for the last twenty or so years. I was ready to push the button here on v5 when a little more hipper spirit nudged me over to the Brooks' side of Zappos. 

While in Brooksville, I travelled to where the Adrenalines hang out.  They looked cool, light, comfy, and came in widths. I chose the stealth black 13 4E. 

I speed walk with my Labrador Retriever 6 miles a day and I'm happy to say I may be faster, certainly more comfortable, and obviously overjoyed in my selection. And yes, I'm coming back for more Adrenaline (Black / Lime and Black / Ketchup) ; one pair for my birthday, and one pair for Christmas.

I've been shopping at Zappos for about 10 years and, ladies and gentlemen, you have not let me down once. I actually look forward to returning shoes (wrong sizes) so I can hang with the customer service folks.

Thanks much for making this guy's shoe buying journey more enjoyable."

The rather thick sole (an apparently growing trend with shoe makers like Hoka and others, who take it to more extremes) provides the perfect levels of stability and movement control, even for users who don’t suffer from severe over-pronation.

I was curious to find out how the slightly lighter new Brooks 20 compared. Like the 18, its engineered mesh upper is comfortable and even a bit mor spacious. The heel counter is toned down but still adequate. So far so good. 

Buts it’s the new guide-rails, popular on so many other new Brooks shoes, that fail as a replacement for the more grounded and stable sole support system of earlier Beasts, including the 18. The 20 and it’s guide rails Just doesn’t provide anything close to the stability and sure-footedness as its 18 predecessor for my large 6’2” frame.

i’m now quite happy that I purchased quite a few 18s in my size."

But this shoe is comfortable once its on(not weatherproof though as top of foot is basically covered in like a cotton mesh) and its much cheaper the my usual go to purchase of 1080v8/9 which is almost 80 bucks more than this shoe. I'm sure you could run in this but at least for me it's just a nice ""stylish"" casual walking shoe."

While I like the original Levitate it didn’t offer some of the features this new model does that set it
apart from other models.  I typically have a tough time breaking in running shoes, dealing with blistering for the first few wears.  With the Levitate 2, the break-in period was non-existent
and I extended my first few runs in them, which I’ve never been able to do before.  I would consider myself an avid runner, but I plan to increase my running regiment based on the comfort 
of this shoe.  Much like the original, it’s lightweight and seems to work well with my flat feet.  Excited to see what additional color ways they plan to launch."

Not the fastest shoe, since this level of cushioning bleeds off your thrust and efficiency, but they are super light.  Most importantly, I can finish a 10-12 mile run in these, and my feet still feel pretty fresh.  Very well protected.

I have always had better luck with ASICS than with any other brand.  As a heavier runner, I find the levels of support and cushioning in the Kayano perfectly suited to my frame.  My only complaint is a petty one.  I wear a 4E width, and I am profoundly grateful to ASICS for manufacturing this top-tier shoe in my width.  I understand that the 4E market is very small, so it is unrealistic to ask for all color schemes to be available in 4E widths.   But I just wish that once in a while they would make the 4E width available in one of the more exciting color schemes.  Typically, the 4E width is only available in the blandest color scheme produced.

Super comfortable, nice cushion, perfect sizing. However, inside the shoe near the arch, there’s a piece of fabric that is stitched along one edge, but not the rest. Rather, it’s coated in adhesive to keep it in place. That adhesive is useless, and the fabric rolls up into an irritating bundle, rubbing against your foot all day. This defect occurred day 1. I would try to rip the fabric out, but the stitched edge prevents that possibility, so I might resort to an xacto knife to cut it out."

The fit and finish is superb and the only real difference (besides the reflective flag on the tongue) is that there is no space on the tongue pad for the top of the laces to go through, but this doesn't seem to be a problem. I wore them for a 7-mile walk last night and my feet were only slightly sore toward the end. I do wish there were more color choices than just black or light gray, but they are quite attractive."

The lightest shoe I've ever run in. However, I have runner's knee and I'm training for a marathon. The HOKA Bondi 6 is about 30% heavier than the Rincon (10.9 oz vs. 7.7 oz), but still doesn't feel ""heavy"" while running and has significantly more cushion for my knees. I was going to wear these Rincons for race day, but have decided to stick with the Bondi 6 for both training and racing.

I wear a Men's 9.5 in casual shoes and 10 in running shoes. These seemed a bit long for 10, but I fear a 9.5 may be too short. The Bondi 6 in 9.5 was too short, but the 10 was perfect. I would say the Rincons run 1/4 a size bigger than the Bondi 6."

The Go Meb Speed 6 is light and quick, with a nice bounce in the sole. 

However, they run at least a half-size, and possibly a full size, smaller than your normal sneaker or running shoe. I'm a size 10 in all other footwear, but a size 10 in these massively pinches my feet, both in width and around the top of the foot (especially around the big-toe area) - so much so that I started developing an abrasion blister after only three four-mile walk/runs in them.

Had a friend's child and pet not destroyed the box, I would return them, but I guess I'm on the hook for another $145 to replace. I'm going to try going up a half-size first, and hopefully I will find the right fit eventually."

As long as I wear socks, the Gaviota 2 works,  Width is good and walking around on these is a feel-good experience. Or perhaps I should write a feet-good experience.

Last year I changed to ghost 11 womens 10.5 which was super comfortable but mid year the fit was changed to more narrow. This seems to be the trend with Brooks.

They have ripped at the forefoot as others have mentioned, as well as had splits along then cuff (?) of the shoe.  Additionally at this point the support has gone and I can no longer run in them.  Thanks to Zappos wonderful support I returned my first pair due to this, and the now the second has had the same issue 3 months in.

At first I was disappointed. I've been using them a couple of months now and I like them. The cushioning is definitely not as cushy which may be an issue for those with foot or joint issues.

In the past year I developed some heel pain and Achilles tendonitis, particularly in the right foot.  I never dreamed of buying a pair of these modified walking boots (my nickname for them), but I tried them on in a store, and just had to have them.  The plan was to use them for my long outdoor runs to help remedy my foot problem.  Super plush, lots of underfoot protection.  Not the fastest shoe, since this level of cushioning bleeds off your thrust and efficiency, but they are super light.  Most importantly, I can finish a 10-12 mile run in these, and my feet still feel pretty fresh.  Very well protected.  Working these into my shoe rotation has helped me recover enough that my weekly mileage has returned to what it was over a year ago.

I found the wider version of this shoe but what you get is a shoe that is about 1/4 inch longer but there's no real change in width and the section of the shoe that holds the laces will dig into the top of your foot because they are too long.  They also have great arch support but if you have high arches and your ankles turn outward (underpronate or supinate) they might make the problem worse.   The sole of this shoe is so comfortable and infact, my sister who has narrow feet and plantar fasciitis tried them on and ended up ordering her own pair and she loves them.  She no longer has pain in her feet and she has found she can stand for 8 hours at work and not have any issues any longer.   My two stars are for the width otherwise it's a great shoe."

Zoom Flys, Pegasus Turbo, Vaporflys, etc.  I’m heavier, at 220, and need a balanced trainer that can blend longer distances with a tempo runs.  I saw the reviews on these and decided to give them a shot. They really do hit a sweet spot that Nike hasn’t been able to hit for me - reasonably priced, comfortable, and versatile shoes I can mix runs around in. I enjoy running in these a lot, and would recommend. They tend to hold sweat/water more than the thinner material of the Nikes, but that appears to be the only real drawback (and I’m nitpicking)."

I have been running with these new shoes for nearly two months and still love the shoe. My previous shoe was a Nike Zoom Odyssey 2. I really liked them but a good friend suggested I try the Hoka brand. Glad I did. These shoes with all the cushioning are still lighter than the Zooms.  I'm 70 years old and these shoes are just what I need to keep me on the trails.  One concern was that the extra layers would lead to wobbly ankle twists but no issues.  I'd buy another pair.
I did enjoy the Hoka website and shoe description of the different running shoes. I chose two that sounded like me and picked the Clifton 6."

It is nice to have a tall, comfortable stack with a zero drop. There are three things that I found to be problems. First, the shoes are longer than others of the same size, by at least a half to a full size, but true to width, so a smaller size may not be an option if your shoes already fit snugly. Second, there is no extra lace hole at the top as found on most running shoes, to permit back-lacing; the result is excess heel slipping. Third, the raised print on the hard details of the inside of the sole saws at your ankle on the occasional graze, to the point of drawing blood; I shaved these off with a scalpel. From a comfort and performance perspective these are among the best Altra has offered. From a design perspective they need a little work."

The cushioning is just the right amount for those long easy runs. The upper fits comfortably and the breathability is what can be expected from this type of material. The only down size is the Heel Collar. The way the stitch is made rubbed against my Achilles and created a blister after my first run. Granted I run in low show socks so from now on I will wear a longer sock with this show.

When they arrived I couldn’t get them on with athletic socks on. So I took off the socks and tried barefoot. Nope, got them on but extremely narrow and my big toes were crammed right up against the toe of the shoes. Also I don’t have a particularly high instep but the tongue didn’t seem to be long enough to cover the top of my foot all the way. Would not have been able to wear them comfortably so I returned them, which is fast and easy with Zappos and I got my refund quickly."

I found the wider version of this shoe but what you get is a shoe that is about 1/4 inch longer but there's no real change in width and the section of the shoe that holds the laces will dig into the top of your foot because they are too long.  They also have great arch support but if you have high arches and your ankles turn outward (underpronate or supinate) they might make the problem worse.   The sole of this shoe is so comfortable and infact, my sister who has narrow feet and plantar fasciitis tried them on and ended up ordering her own pair and she loves them.  She no longer has pain in her feet and she has found she can stand for 8 hours at work and not have any issues any longer.   My two stars are for the width otherwise it's a great shoe."

I had trained in them for about a month before running a half marathon in them.   They were fantastic for the first 8-9 miles, but by mile 10 I had a horrendous hotfoot in the left shoe and really struggled to finish the race.  It could have been the laces being too tight, it could have been a bad sock choice, or maybe they just take a while to properly break in.

Lots of room in the toe box and the overall fit is great. I still somewhat prefer the Nimubus 17s for their great forefoot comfort, but overall the Cumulus 21s are very good."

It's a waking city, and walk everywhere, to and from work, to Central Park, shopping and bopping.

The 990 is a legendary shoe, and the V5 has made subtle improvements. The arch and footbed support is improved over the V4. The tongue has much more padding. The side support is better. It might not be the sleekest runner ever, but it's a classic. I can spend the entire day in my 990's and my feet feel fresh.

Zappos and their customer service consistently blow me away. Same thing with my friends. There are a few companies that have fantastic customer service...Bose and T-Mobile come to mind, but Zappos is the standard."

The ISOFIT is both a pro and con for this shoe.  While it does allow a lot of flexibility for how the upper portion fits your foot, it does take some time to adjust it.  Because of the form you can adjust pretty much all the areas of the shoe for varying degrees of tightness and feel, which may take some time and a number of runs to adjust for your comfort.  The shoes have a pretty good amount of cushioning that makes them feel soft yet still supportive rather than a spongy feel.  Once you get the fit dialed in they are comfortable, but that can take a while."

Unfortunately for me the shoe has one very annoying flaw and that is the insole.  After wearing the shoes a couple of times both of the shoe's insoles started sliding around and becoming a nuisance. Typically this would not be a big deal but for a pair of shoes that retails for $180 I would expect better quality.  I have not always been a big Adidas fan until the past couple years and am not a big fan of their products. I hope they can get this issue resolved for future models.

My only complaint is a petty one.  I wear a 4E width, and I am profoundly grateful to ASICS for manufacturing this top-tier shoe in my width.  I understand that the 4E market is very small, so it is unrealistic to ask for all color schemes to be available in 4E widths.   But I just wish that once in a while they would make the 4E width available in one of the more exciting color schemes.  Typically, the 4E width is only available in the blandest color scheme produced.

Today, I've worn them for the entire day, on hardwood floors, tiled floors, and for a few short runs around the block on concrete sidewalks. And I have changed my mind about them. Yes, their soles are not quite as stiff (some might say rigid) as those on the Brooks 18 and previous model Beasts. But they are still more firm and supportive than almost any running (not walking) shoe I've ever worn. The sole bottoms are as wide as the 18s, providing a nice stable platform. The rear heel counters are far less stiff and confining than those on the 18, providing good support but sparing me any of the achilles heel and ankle twinges I occasionally experience with the 18s. The breathable pliable engineered mesh over the top middle and toe box areas provides  even more room for the foot and toes than on the 18s, something I'll be able to appreciate late on a hot summer day when my feet sometimes begin to swell a bit. My wife says they look much better than the 18s, which she thought were too thick in the sole and clunky looking. Fact is that the 20's sole is the same thickness as that on the 18s. But Brooks has built and engineered them, together with their large inside guiderails, to look far less beefy and far more sleek and stylish, like a slightly thicker-soled GTS 20. To longtime devotees of the Brooks Beast who are larger and on the heavier side (with over-pronation) than my 6'2"" 180 pound frame, the Beast 18s might still be the definitely preferable shoe. I can only say that, for myself, giving the Beast 20 a good workout and a second chance proved to me just how comfortable and enjoyable they are."

I found the wider version of this shoe but what you get is a shoe that is about 1/4 inch longer but there's no real change in width and the section of the shoe that holds the laces will dig into the top of your foot because they are too long.  They also have great arch support but if you have high arches and your ankles turn outward (underpronate or supinate) they might make the problem worse.   The sole of this shoe is so comfortable and infact, my sister who has narrow feet and plantar fasciitis tried them on and ended up ordering her own pair and she loves them.  She no longer has pain in her feet and she has found she can stand for 8 hours at work and not have any issues any longer.   My two stars are for the width otherwise it's a great shoe."

As long as I wear socks, the Gaviota 2 works,  Width is good and walking around on these is a feel-good experience. Or perhaps I should write a feet-good experience. The sole of this sneaker flairs out just enough to provide the stability I need. Plus the Gaviota 2 is practically weightless. I am truly pleased with this purchase."

I tried all different types of insoles, cortisone shots at the podiatrist and rollers at night and morning. I thought I was going to be stuck with incredibly painful first steps (even after short periods of sitting) for the rest of my life. I used to only wear new balance. This is my first pair of Brooks. I bought these shoes right before Christmas and have worn them everyday since purchase. I no longer have pain in my foot/heel. It's a miracle! I didn't switch out or change the insoles, just kept the ones in that they came with. I think I'm going to stock up on these and might buy a few other Brooks sneakers. Thanks for changing my life!"

Now for the actual shoes. As I read while shopping around, I can confirm that these shoes are big, decently larger than normal running shoes. Due to that, they give off a “dad vibe” and I would never wear these other than for the purpose of running. The pictures I uploaded are compared to my 3 year old On Clouds for size comparison and you can see they are substantially larger. The toe box is wide which works for me because I feel I’m too wide for a regular shoe and too narrow for a wide shoe. I never buy anything other than normal width shoes size wide shoes are way too wide, and I often feel the side of my feet bunch against the side walls. These shoes are comfortable when running. The dual layer of clouds is nice if you’re a runner whose heel hits first as I do. No matter how much I try to alter, I always resort back to a natural heel, toe, heel, toe stride when running and my heels would hurt after runs of 5 miles or more. After a 5 mile run the other day, no heel pain. Since the shoe is bigger, you can notice the additional weight compared to other On shoes, and the back of the shoe rides higher up the heel. My heel was rubbed raw after my first run while wearing no show socks. During my second run, I wore low cut socks as opposed to no shows, and I didn’t tighten the top laces as tight and didn’t have an issue with the heel. I’m going to keep them but I will probably go back to the normal sized On shoes after I wear these out. I will update if anything changes."

There is very little arch support in these, nor is there support (a “bump”) in the middle-front to open the toes a bit. That’s what my custom insoles do. Everyone’s feet are different, so why not allow for customized insoles? Just my two cents. Otherwise these would be great shoes."

I have, and have had, several pairs of Altra shoes. I really like the wide toe box, this is what attracted me to their shoes. These shoes are true to size. I wear a 11 1/2 size shoe, medium width. The width is true to size. These shoes do not have arch support insoles or inserts that support the arch. I like the style of this shoe as well as the color but disappointingly that is where it ends. 
I received these today, 6/13/2019, and I am returning them. They are not defective and Zappos makes it very easy to order shoes and for returns. I have never had a problem with Zappos, they provide excellent service.
These shoes, for the price, feel inferior and feel like they are made of cheap materials, especially the inserts. I know some people want light shoes, particularly people who are runners, I get that. I am not an outdoor runner nor run to compete in any kind of competitions but if I were, these definitely would not be the shoes I would purchase for that purpose. I don't know how they could hold up very long with a long run or even putting them in the washer they feel like they would come apart too easily. I just don't feel the quality for the price. I expected much better than this from Altra. They use a lot of lingo and fancy words for their shoes to market them for sell but all that lingo means nothing if the materials of the shoe feel cheap. And really, how much does it cost to make these in China? 
One of the things that also is misleading to me is in the description for the support type. For these shoes it says the support type is neutral or underpronation. I am a underpronator, in other words, my feet have the tendency to lean to the outside and shoes always wear to the outside of the shoe. When I tried on these shoes they feel like they actually will cause the feet to lean to the outside, which goes against what I need. I need support to help prevent that from happening or at least slow it down. Perhaps I am misunderstanding what is meant by support type or for these shoes it may be a wrong description.
I am deeply disappointed in these shoes and if this is the direction that Altra is going in, I may need to find a new brand. I don't want a cheap made shoe for a high price. Materials just don't match the price or the quality. They really do feel like they would break down very quickly. I have other Torins and they are the Torin 3. I have two pairs of those and they have held up well. They actually were cheaper in price and have a higher quality feel to them. I purchased those in April 2018. Not badly worn yet and have held up well with several washings. These Torin 4 Plush just don't have it. Sorry Altra, but don't put fancy words on a shoe and add the word Plush to it and make people think it's better so you can put a higher price on it, that's deception and not cool! 
Make quality shoes of quality materials and go back to what was working. I don't know what has happened or who is designing the shoes, but for me, the quality has gone down while the price has gone up, and that's not good!"

The lightest shoe I've ever run in. However, I have runner's knee and I'm training for a marathon. The HOKA Bondi 6 is about 30% heavier than the Rincon (10.9 oz vs. 7.7 oz), but still doesn't feel ""heavy"" while running and has significantly more cushion for my knees. I was going to wear these Rincons for race day, but have decided to stick with the Bondi 6 for both training and racing.

I wear a Men's 9.5 in casual shoes and 10 in running shoes. These seemed a bit long for 10, but I fear a 9.5 may be too short. The Bondi 6 in 9.5 was too short, but the 10 was perfect. I would say the Rincons run 1/4 a size bigger than the Bondi 6."

I had trained in them for about a month before running a half marathon in them.   They were fantastic for the first 8-9 miles, but by mile 10 I had a horrendous hotfoot in the left shoe and really struggled to finish the race.  It could have been the laces being too tight, it could have been a bad sock choice, or maybe they just take a while to properly break in.

In this way lacing through the tongue nib that allowed laces to keep running sneakers tongues from sliding too far left or right is merely a placebo other than maybe assuring the top of your foot covering does not slide down below the top row of laces but my foot fit so snugly that it was not a concern and other than my confusion in putting the shoe on my EE width size 12 sneakers in these somewhat risky 12 D sneakers that I have owned in 12D twice before and were just wide enough to not pinch my boat-feet (as I call them).  Mizuno's  Wave Creation 20s are the finest running shoes overall, that I have owned so far-  for aesthetics, for encouraging best habits in running and striking mid-foot and rather than stabilize my feet (that I find actually hurts as I am likely mild underpronator, or neutral,  but I have found that ""control"" runners wind up hurting my ankles and tiring me more than those that let me run with my natural flow but encourage it which Mizunos all seem to do in my humble opinion.
 Have found from my first try of Mizunos about 5 years ago  that they seem to  encourage me to run more  properly by making me land towards  mid-foot (as its not so soft as a heel striking shoe that negates any feeling pf  impact to firm asphalt road  ( so will feel more impact if you land on your heel so you tend to try to run by landing more properly on your mid foot and so your naturally in position to  raise into  your next stride.... its not a rebound or an energetic bounce one might find in an air cushioned support runner like the pair of  Nike VaporMax I found to be my favorite comfort runners last summer... but the Mizuno Wave Creations frame has their patented ""infinite wave"" ( a (figure 8  thats really a 2 layers of impact to protect your feet and to give it natural flow) that really helps your foot glide up into the next stride (with a hint of assistance from the shoes flexing up from the prior impact as it moves through the frame of the shoes rear to the front of your foot) so it just seems to support your foot in the best most natural way forward.
     I cannot explain the physics of the Mizuno as its not a bouncy shoe its an impact absorbtion that flexes into the frame of the show and returns some help into the next stride so they do have an energetic feel not the dead feel of some squishy soft sneakers that feel great on landing on heel but then it feels hard to lift into the next stride as they deaden the weight rather than rebound you forward into the next stride...so having said the best about them I can now say that ---they are not my favorite sneakers to run in when my back hurts!!.  In  that case I probably should just use the elliptical--- but sometimes I will take out my bouncier sneakers like the VaporFly AIrMax Nikes (they tend to get flat tires after a few months shhh)  so I am not a big proponent of  other shoes other  than to say they do reduce impact most  of any shoes (along with the Hoka One Cavus I just bought  for bad back days)  and maybe the Beast works  for some folks, but they seemed to  slow me down when I tried them a few weeks ago.  The Wave Creatiion 20s are shoes I would choose to wear when I was feeling rested and not having back pain are these Wave Creation 20s encourage my best performance: I feel like a real runner in my Mizuno Wave Creation 20s- on good days!  
  These creatiion 20s  keep my  feet landing smoothly without any jolt and with mild spring taking off into the next stride forward with minimal bounce, or recoil to point of squishiness that some of the most cushy runners (like maybe the Beast) and others with loads of padding, might encourage bigger guys like me to run back on our heels (and wind up making my back hurt more from that habit in general).  For me the cradling effect that surrounds my foot by fusing the tongue like a webbed foot to the shoe (but its not tight or uncomfortable, in fact its the opposite, it makes you feel your foot is securely protected and makes you think less about obsessing over adjusting the top laces, or using the very top lace holes to thread or the ""normal' top hole of sneakers to thread the laces through and tie them (double or single knot? Double normally for me but with these I felt I could run without my laces tied and I might not care as my foot was well in place with the laces being merely an extra nice touch that they are tied-but maybe not necessary other than to feel slightly more tight (as my feet are big, wide and arches fairly high so top of my big feet make me a heavy Clydesdale, runner at 235-240...so for cushioning and support for bigger runners Mizuno has a higher end sneaker to Creation Wave Inspires at $229. and usually a lmited number available on Zappos or even Amazon, I only have owned 2 pairs of those and they are like more expensive verions of the Wave Creations as they are similar in design only more strongly framed and perhaps they can handle an even larger weight though they also do not cushion so much as support a larger runner to run with better form...so you might look into those if your over 235-240 as the Creations are near their limit I think at around my weight, though someone may review and prove me wrong here...
    .I am never going to be fast, or competitive runner, but I do  appreciate a supportive shoe that respects runners of all levels, and Mizuno may not sell a model that is the comfort equivalent of  the Brooks  Beast,( or a NB 990]994s?)  that seem to attract all the  bigger heavier runners ...but it does have the Wave Creation for us pretty. big guys and for the really big guys I would recommend their Wave Prophecies- as those are both very solid running shoes for Clydesdale runners and bigger and heavier runners needing serious shoes.  Hope this helps somebody as I find very few big guy reviews and this is one of them in a shoe that is good for medium size guys to big heavier guys but not going to be a comfort shoe, its a shoe that is comfortable enough to use if you run with reasonable form and know what its design gives you. You likely will want another pair for days when your back hurts and the Hoka One Cavus or Beasts or Nike AirMax might offer that type of heel strike impact aborbant comfort that these do not provide but will help you avoid needing the comfort runners if you use them before you let yourself hurt your back by running in bad shoes with bad form. Cheers!"

Now onto the bad, the shoe seems lighter because it feels like they cheaper on the material. Gone is the good side support which has been replaced thin lightweight fabric. Add to the fact they opted for grey and brown which doesn't go together all that well it seems like Brooks has stuck to the design idea of one step forward two steps back."

I feel like the sizing is accurate for me, a 14 feels like every other 14. The width is fine for my slightly narrow feet. I’ve been on a couple shorter runs and one long run thus far. I don’t notice the rocker at all. I have noticed extra strain in my ankles and calves during and after runs, but my feet, knees, and back love these shoes. I ran two hours one day (long for me at this point) and was able to hit a personal best back squat the next day.

While the shoe feels like it runs a little wider in the toe box, the rest of the shoe feels a bit narrow. 

On top of that Brooks seems to have opted for cheaper materials so the shoe is lacking the support it once had in the side of the shoes. There is a noticeable difference in materials between past Dyads and this model while this probably lets the shoe breathe better and lends itself to a slightly lighter shoe, it removes the side support the shoe was once known for.

Add to that the ugly color options and you have another mixed bag shoe from Brooks."

I have been a New Balance 990 guy for the last twenty or so years. I was ready to push the button here on v5 when a little more hipper spirit nudged me over to the Brooks' side of Zappos. 

While in Brooksville, I travelled to where the Adrenalines hang out.  They looked cool, light, comfy, and came in widths. I chose the stealth black 13 4E. 

I speed walk with my Labrador Retriever 6 miles a day and I'm happy to say I may be faster, certainly more comfortable, and obviously overjoyed in my selection. And yes, I'm coming back for more Adrenaline (Black / Lime and Black / Ketchup) ; one pair for my birthday, and one pair for Christmas.

I've been shopping at Zappos for about 10 years and, ladies and gentlemen, you have not let me down once. I actually look forward to returning shoes (wrong sizes) so I can hang with the customer service folks.

Thanks much for making this guy's shoe buying journey more enjoyable."

I have always had better luck with ASICS than with any other brand.  As a heavier runner, I find the levels of support and cushioning in the Kayano perfectly suited to my frame.  My only complaint is a petty one.  I wear a 4E width, and I am profoundly grateful to ASICS for manufacturing this top-tier shoe in my width.  I understand that the 4E market is very small, so it is unrealistic to ask for all color schemes to be available in 4E widths.   But I just wish that once in a while they would make the 4E width available in one of the more exciting color schemes.  Typically, the 4E width is only available in the blandest color scheme produced.  As I said, it is a petty complaint, and I can live with the bland colors as long as the shoes permit me to continue running injury-free."

Before the Nimbus 17s I had a pair of Cumulus 16s, which I liked a lot, but they weren't cushioned enough, especially in the forefoot. These Cumulus 21s are much better than the Cumulus 16s.

This was noticeable when stationary but wasn't much of an issue when on the move. The new top gives a much more secure feel while still breathable. These would be great as running shoes but don't plan on using it as a daily 24/7 shoe. You may not notice that it is restricting your feet at first but after half an hour or longer, you'll want to take them off to let your feet spay out. This feels more like a normal shoe with zero drop rather than the large open toe box of Altra. I have fairly narrow feet also, which makes me think it would be even worse for most people. Sizing up half a size may fix this but may also cause other issues such as heel slippage. The heel in the back does go up higher. This will probably give more secure fit but it also rubs a bit more than the 1.5 did. The midsole is a little more firm, which I actually preferred. It won't have as soft on initial feel but I think it provides better comfort/support beyond the initial 15 mins. The bottom has more foam removed for areas that would bend to give it more flexibility but the rubber sole has basically no threads. It is very slippery on wet and smooth surfaces. My year olf 1.5s had better grip than these 2.0 brand new. Overall, I am disappointed with the revision. On initial try, I thought this would be my new favorite shoe as it felt much more secure than the 1.5 did. The restrictive top material on the toebox was the deal breaker for me.

This v3 is by far the WORST so far and a definite step backwards by NB - if Zappos has an old dusty box of v2 13EE's lying around, I'd gladly trade for them. As others have said, while the width when you look at the shoe inserts is about the same, and the length actually appears to be slightly longer, the fit is definitely tighter, meaning the vertical size of the interior must be smaller. Whoever the marketing genius is that decided to ""improve"" this model version should be fired, or at least forced to wear these damn shoes. The stability still seems as good as before but every other aspect of this shoe is worse than before. The tongue is too short, the heal height is too short, and even the freaking the laces are too short. I've been wearing this pair, hoping they would break in better, so can't really return them, but I now need to search beyond New Balance for good shoes."

The width and size is right on these and the support is pretty good, although we did add a different (more firm) insole. He didn't like them much when he first got a pair because he felt they pitched him forward, however, once he got used to the different feel of them, he is a big fan.

The store gave me a deal because I was their only customer who could wear them. They were the only shoes I ever had that truly fit until the magic of online shopping allowed me to find such shoes again. Even so, they are few and far between. In fact, these are the first running shoes I’ve seen. I usually settle for B’s. I walk 5-7 miles a day on NYC sidewalks, so I need a good shoe. These fit the bill for that so far. I’ve only worn them for about 3 weeks. I’ll see how long they last, but my previous, cheaper pairs of New Balance have done well. I usually can get my 10.5 foot into an 11 NB B-width. These required a full size bigger. My foot fits like a glove. At first, I thought they were too narrow and then I removed the extra pair of socks that I always wear in all my other shoes. Perfect!  Gave style 4 stars only because I really wanted a pair of whites and I had a choice between black and black. I admit that I get tired of the NB logo, too. But I’m grateful to the company for filling a very small market niche. There are not a lot of men’s AA feet out there.  P.S. It’s a little thing. I’ve been double-tying running shoes for years because the furshligginer laces keep untying. These are hard to UNTIE when I double-tie them, but when I single-tie them, they usually stay tied. May their tribe increase."

The tongue is too short like everyone else says. The heels are a little weak so I might not be able to slip these one sometime like other quality sturdy shoes. There is a little extra room around the toes. I don't this this will bother me, the room is there if you need it. 

So the heal area is cheapened and weakened a little with the mesh outer.   Some bean counter probley Oked to small tongue too.  Then they plaster Made in the USA all over these. Give me a break! You keep cheaping these shoes that you want a FORTUNE FOR.  They is no noticeable technology about this shoe. The footbed has good support and is wide but there is nothing spectacular about the insole softness.   You could get away with some $60 Sketchers.   I also buy very expensive Clarks and other high quality shoes. 

I am keeping them because of other statements about foot support but that is the only reason. I dont mind paying for a quality shoe but these dont impress me."

These are my first pair of Hoka's and I think I'm going to come back to this brand in the future. Here's what I'm using each shoe for:
Hoka One One Rincon's: races/events of all distances. Half-marathon on under.
New Balance Fresh Foam Beacon's: Treadmill training and possible short races like 5K's

This pair has a hole now (inner lining near the heel, exposing plastic), 4 months after purchase. They were not worn every day, maybe every other day for an hour or two. They should not wear out this quickly, but in my experience, all Hokas do wear out this quickly. The sole material also compresses pretty fast, making them much less cushy in just a few months. Overall, I still like these shoes because they are really comfortable, but I'm finding the value lacking. For $100-$150+, a shoe should last *at least* 6-8 months."

The recent versions of the Nimbus have been getting pretty bad reviews, so I was looking for an alternative replacement. Before the Nimbus 17s I had a pair of Cumulus 16s, which I liked a lot, but they weren't cushioned enough, especially in the forefoot. These Cumulus 21s are much better than the Cumulus 16s. Lots of room in the toe box and the overall fit is great. I still somewhat prefer the Nimubus 17s for their great forefoot comfort, but overall the Cumulus 21s are very good."

The recent versions of the Nimbus have been getting pretty bad reviews, so I was looking for an alternative replacement. Before the Nimbus 17s I had a pair of Cumulus 16s, which I liked a lot, but they weren't cushioned enough, especially in the forefoot. These Cumulus 21s are much better than the Cumulus 16s. Lots of room in the toe box and the overall fit is great. I still somewhat prefer the Nimubus 17s for their great forefoot comfort, but overall the Cumulus 21s are very good."

The store gave me a deal because I was their only customer who could wear them. They were the only shoes I ever had that truly fit until the magic of online shopping allowed me to find such shoes again. Even so, they are few and far between. In fact, these are the first running shoes I’ve seen. I usually settle for B’s. I walk 5-7 miles a day on NYC sidewalks, so I need a good shoe. These fit the bill for that so far. I’ve only worn them for about 3 weeks. I’ll see how long they last, but my previous, cheaper pairs of New Balance have done well. I usually can get my 10.5 foot into an 11 NB B-width. These required a full size bigger. My foot fits like a glove. At first, I thought they were too narrow and then I removed the extra pair of socks that I always wear in all my other shoes. Perfect!  Gave style 4 stars only because I really wanted a pair of whites and I had a choice between black and black. I admit that I get tired of the NB logo, too. But I’m grateful to the company for filling a very small market niche. There are not a lot of men’s AA feet out there.  P.S. It’s a little thing. I’ve been double-tying running shoes for years because the furshligginer laces keep untying. These are hard to UNTIE when I double-tie them, but when I single-tie them, they usually stay tied. May their tribe increase."

I found the wider version of this shoe but what you get is a shoe that is about 1/4 inch longer but there's no real change in width and the section of the shoe that holds the laces will dig into the top of your foot because they are too long.  They also have great arch support but if you have high arches and your ankles turn outward (underpronate or supinate) they might make the problem worse.   The sole of this shoe is so comfortable and infact, my sister who has narrow feet and plantar fasciitis tried them on and ended up ordering her own pair and she loves them.

I have been a New Balance 990 guy for the last twenty or so years. I was ready to push the button here on v5 when a little more hipper spirit nudged me over to the Brooks' side of Zappos. 

While in Brooksville, I travelled to where the Adrenalines hang out.  They looked cool, light, comfy, and came in widths. I chose the stealth black 13 4E. 

I speed walk with my Labrador Retriever 6 miles a day and I'm happy to say I may be faster, certainly more comfortable, and obviously overjoyed in my selection. And yes, I'm coming back for more Adrenaline (Black / Lime and Black / Ketchup) ; one pair for my birthday, and one pair for Christmas.

I've been shopping at Zappos for about 10 years and, ladies and gentlemen, you have not let me down once. I actually look forward to returning shoes (wrong sizes) so I can hang with the customer service folks.

Thanks much for making this guy's shoe buying journey more enjoyable."

I wore them running for a couple of days and was so impressed with them, that I bought a second pair; different color (white). the fact that I ordered two pairs of the same shoe(s) in one week pretty much sums up my feelings for these shoes. Typically, I wear Hoka One One shoes. For some reason,( probably the pretty yellow color available), I decided to give these New Balance a try. They don't have the same support as Hokas, but they are still a great shoes  for middle distance running; Hoka shoes (my opinion) are better for long distance running. If you are a 5 or 10k runner, these new Balance 1500v6 are great shoes. If you are running anything over a 10K, I would recommend Hoka One One shoes. By the way, the yellow color and the white color for these particular shoes (NB 1500v6) are super beautiful colors. I wish more shoes were available in yellow"

These fit me like the proverbial glove in a 10.5, and I'm about to order a second pair.  I have kind of painful feet, and Saucony is the brand that seems to fit me the best, while also having the specs I need in a walking shoe, which is what I use running shoes for.  The low heel-to-toe drop of the old Triumph 11, the Zealot ISO and now this Ride ISO2 is exactly what I need.  But unlike those models, these are incredibly cushy.  The midsole cushioning is a revelation, as is the lack of weight and large footprint of the Triumph ISO3s I also have.  The energy return is better than any shoe in any brand I've ever worn.  I could just walk and walk, and my feet don't kill me.  And they're a such good-looking shoes in the black color.  As much as I admire the flash and neon colors of other running shoes, I'm not a flashy person. 
 What a fantastic shoe - I love them.  Grab them while you can because as sure as the sun comes up, Saucony will change them next season."

These fit me like the proverbial glove in a 10.5, and I'm about to order a second pair.  I have kind of painful feet, and Saucony is the brand that seems to fit me the best, while also having the specs I need in a walking shoe, which is what I use running shoes for.  The low heel-to-toe drop of the old Triumph 11, the Zealot ISO and now this Ride ISO2 is exactly what I need.  But unlike those models, these are incredibly cushy.  The midsole cushioning is a revelation, as is the lack of weight and large footprint of the Triumph ISO3s I also have.  The energy return is better than any shoe in any brand I've ever worn.  I could just walk and walk, and my feet don't kill me.  And they're a such good-looking shoes in the black color.  As much as I admire the flash and neon colors of other running shoes, I'm not a flashy person. 
 What a fantastic shoe - I love them.  Grab them while you can because as sure as the sun comes up, Saucony will change them next season."

The cushioning is just the right amount for those long easy runs. The upper fits comfortably and the breathability is what can be expected from this type of material. The only down size is the Heel Collar. The way the stitch is made rubbed against my Achilles and created a blister after my first run. Granted I run in low show socks so from now on I will wear a longer sock with this show.

It is nice to have a tall, comfortable stack with a zero drop. There are three things that I found to be problems. First, the shoes are longer than others of the same size, by at least a half to a full size, but true to width, so a smaller size may not be an option if your shoes already fit snugly. Second, there is no extra lace hole at the top as found on most running shoes, to permit back-lacing; the result is excess heel slipping. Third, the raised print on the hard details of the inside of the sole saws at your ankle on the occasional graze, to the point of drawing blood; I shaved these off with a scalpel. From a comfort and performance perspective these are among the best Altra has offered. From a design perspective they need a little work."

I truly hope they do make a shoe next that has even more squish to the cushion and my only real gripe would be the tongue was like scratchy without socks when I first tried them on. So as a slip on and do something quick kind of messed that up but with socks The shoe is awesome. But please fix the tongue and add more squish to the cushion and I think this would beat 95% of comfort shoes on the market. God bless

Overall, the shoe looks and feels similar to the 35. However, one subtle change that significantly affected fit was the rubber overlay around the top edge of the toe box. It is between 1/2 and 3/4 of an inch and goes from one side of the ball of your foot over the top of the ends of your toes and back down the other side to the ball of your foot. In speaking with Nike they said it was to provide some additional support. What I found it prevented my toes from expanding and made the toe box feel tighter. I liked previous versions because I have 10 4E feet so the shoes always fit and allowed my toes to expand. Unfortunately because of this small change I had to return the shoes and will be looking for a new everyday running shoe."

Now all is good. Try the Sorbathane insole with the 10mm arch basically flat and very comfortable. Takes a tad more space than the one that comes with the shoe, good for my narrow feet.

They break in quickly, are incredibly comfortable and hold up better than 80% of the running shoes I've owned. I can say without hesitation that I've loved every pair. 

Until now. 

With this pair, the padded material at the top of the right shoe's Heel Counter caused a blister to form the first day I wore them. I figured it was break-in related and continued wearing them with adhesive blister protectors over my Achilles tendon for another week. It's been almost two months now and I still have to wear a blister protector at the top of my right heel when wearing these shoes. 

My luck with ON shoes has been great in the past so hopefully mine is an isolated problem. I still believe ON makes some of the best running shoes out there and I will continue to support the brand."

While the shoe feels like it runs a little wider in the toe box, the rest of the shoe feels a bit narrow. 

On top of that Brooks seems to have opted for cheaper materials so the shoe is lacking the support it once had in the side of the shoes. There is a noticeable difference in materials between past Dyads and this model while this probably lets the shoe breathe better and lends itself to a slightly lighter shoe, it removes the side support the shoe was once known for.

Add to that the ugly color options and you have another mixed bag shoe from Brooks."

That might be from the webbed design that this new model has over the older Clifton models. The toe box was also not right for me (too constricting) as well as strangely shaped inwards but for some reason, the length was ok. Odd. Zappos did not have a 12 1/2 so I bought that somewhere else. After three days of those Hoka Clifton 6's, I had to return them also since they literally destroyed my feet. My Plantar Fasciitis which I have not felt in 10 years of wearing Asics came back with a vengeance, as well as the slight Metatarsalgia that I have also forgotten about. This is due to the fore foot not having enough room to splay your toes correctly and not having any support for the Metatarsal region. I suppose the rocker mid sole that these shoe are known for are doing this. Bad design for me. I learned my lesson. I could only imagine if I put up with the discomfort any longer in order to ""break these in"". 

Also, these sneakers are advertised as ""neutral"" which is why I bought them in the first place but I found that the inner soles were slightly high as opposed to the outer parts of the soles that I was standing slightly uncomfortably bowed. I would NOT recommend these for anyone that has arch problems, Metatarsalgia, arthritis or Morton's Neuroma problems of any sort because these sneakers will only make those conditions much worse. They have absolutely no extra room to put your own orthotics in and only make the overall constricting feeling worse on your toes and arches.

I fell for the advertising. This new model is supposed to be the roomiest most comfortable of the whole Hoka One One line and I've seen some Foot Doctors actually recommending these because of the cushioning. The overall cushioning IS good I do admit, if that is what you are looking for, but Hoka is off my list for good."

I bumped up my daily walk from 5 to 8 miles a day (I try to walk a sub 15 minute mile consistently). I had ordered some Adidas trail shoes and although they were nice they were heavy and not good for the walking that I’m doing. I received my Nova Flows and put them to the test and they were great. Cushioning was great, sung running shoe fit and a thin tongue which helps as not to bruise the top of your foot. I like these so much I’m considering buying an identical pair for when I wear them out, because at this point no one knows when we’re going back to a normal life. But seriously, I’d recommend these shoes. Stay safe ?"

Little arch support and tighter knit but love the deign change and fit remains the same as what I wear in Nike.
